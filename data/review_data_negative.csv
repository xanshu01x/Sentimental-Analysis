0,Disaster Movie,2.0,58,Entertainment Weekly," The movie is merciless sending up ""Juno's"" self-satisfied hipster gobbledygook, and it's quite funny to see Hannah Montana still promoting her tie-in products as she lies crushed and dying under a meteor. "
1,Disaster Movie,2.0,25,TV Guide Magazine," Lazy, superficially au courant and utterly forgettable. "
2,Disaster Movie,2.0,20,Variety," Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than Disaster Movie, yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce. "
3,Disaster Movie,2.0,20,The Hollywood Reporter, Real disaster movies have more laughs than this spoof. 
4,Disaster Movie,2.0,20,New York Daily News," Why would you watch a bad movie about better movies, when you could just rent the originals instead? "
5,Disaster Movie,2.0,20,The New York Times," Does little more than congratulate its audience on recognizing the source of its riffs. ""High School Musical"" -- ha ha ha! "
6,Disaster Movie,2.0,20,Empire," A horrific waste of time, money and oxygen. "
7,Disaster Movie,2.0,16,The A.V. Club," It's too easy to say Disaster Movie deserves its title, but why put more effort into trashing it than the filmmakers did into writing it? "
8,Disaster Movie,2.0,12,Boston Globe, The filmmakers are idiots. 
9,Disaster Movie,2.0,0,L.A. Weekly, This carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores. 
10,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,50,Entertainment Weekly," The film's moral? Turn off the TV, young 'uns, and go outside and play! And avoid Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 matinees while you're at it. "
11,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The sequel retains not only the same gimmicky premise as the original but its preference for cliche-ridden dialogue and flat-footed comedy as well. 
12,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,30,TV Guide Magazine, Entirely too convoluted for kids and implausible even by the standards set by the original concept. 
13,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,25,USA Today," Here's a late-August dog-days atrocity from the ""aren't farts funny?"" school of filmmaking. "
14,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,25,New York Daily News, Features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible. 
15,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,20,L.A. Weekly," As for anyone else who may experience a sudden need for therapy after sitting through this, you're on your own. "
16,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,20,Variety," Falls short on nearly every level, from production values to an inexplicable cameo by Whoopi Goldberg. "
17,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,20,Washington Post, So bad that I predict there will be drinking games set around viewing it someday. 
18,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,0,Dallas Observer," The first Baby Geniuses, released in 1999, was one of the most inane, humorless, ill-conceived, poorly acted comedies of the year. As difficult as it is to imagine, the sequel is even worse, earning an F. "
19,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.1,0,The New York Times," Villainy toward the infant class now comes from Jon Voight, descending to the depths of his 37-year-career. "
20,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,33,Entertainment Weekly," The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie & the Nottie, a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep. "
21,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,30,Washington Post," Like Nate, we are mere Notties. And we are supposed to feel oh-so privileged for getting to watch Paris through the glass. "
22,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Though Hilton may be a model, if her work in Hottie is any indication, she is no actress. "
23,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,12,Chicago Tribune, Verdict: not so hot 
24,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,12,ReelViews, A cinematic excursion so horrific that it's an insult to bad movies to call it a bad movie. 
25,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,12,Rolling Stone," That generous half star rating I tacked onto this comedy abomination is all for Paris Hilton. Come on, it takes guts (or gross dim-wittedness) to appear on screen again after ""House of Wax."" "
26,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,0,Village Voice," Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny. "
27,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,0,Variety," Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's ""Bottom 100."" The Hottie and the Nottie will make it an even four. "
28,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,0,The A.V. Club," How is Paris Hilton in her first starring role to receive a national release? Pretty bad, actually. She's limited to a single, all-too-familiar expression of smug self-satisfaction, and she delivers her lines in a tone somewhere between ""seductive"" and ""dish-soap commercial."" "
29,The Hottie & the Nottie,2.2,0,TV Guide Magazine," Preposterous, disingenuous, remarkably unfunny and genuinely distasteful. "
30,House of the Dead,2.3,50,Variety, Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on just how much 14-year-old boy you've got in ya. 
31,House of the Dead,2.3,40,Los Angeles Times," There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun. "
32,House of the Dead,2.3,38,New York Daily News," Director Uwe Boll wholeheartedly embraces the film's concept, and with some fancy editing and a pulsing soundtrack, the effect really is like watching a video game. "
33,House of the Dead,2.3,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Somewhere between cartoonishly bad for comic effect and bad because the filmmakers didn't really give a damn, The House of the Dead is, at least, unpretentiously dumb. "
34,House of the Dead,2.3,25,Boston Globe," House of the Dead, sadly, is so bad it's bad. "
35,House of the Dead,2.3,20,The New York Times," Does little more than add another title to the very long list of movies influenced by George Romero's 1968 horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" "
36,House of the Dead,2.3,20,The A.V. Club," Much poorly choreographed gunplay, many lovingly rendered head explosions, and some half-assed exposition about centuries-old, immortality-seeking pirates follow, with nothing to recommend House Of The Dead to anyone but the most undiscriminating zombie-movie fans. "
37,House of the Dead,2.3,20,Film Threat," Here’s a would-be horror film that contains not one ounce of professional pride in its making, not one shred of technical competence. This is one of the worst films of recent times. "
38,House of the Dead,2.3,20,The Hollywood Reporter, Laughable performances. 
39,House of the Dead,2.3,0,New York Post," Based on a video game, far exceeds expectations -- in negative ways that inspire thoughts of less than zero stars. "
40,Saving Christmas,2.3,40,Austin Chronicle," Saving Christmas will hold little interest for anyone not already a believer. It’s too single-minded in its instructional purpose, too averse to multidimensional characters, too youth-pastor-like in its dorky humor. "
41,Saving Christmas,2.3,40,Arizona Republic," Beyond the leaps in logic, the most troubling part of this film is that it just feels like a defense of the excess of Christmas. "
42,Saving Christmas,2.3,30,The New York Times, Saving Christmas seems determined to win any perceived war on Christmas through brute force. 
43,Saving Christmas,2.3,25,Chicago Sun-Times, This may be one of the least artful holiday films ever made. Even devout born-again Christians will find this hard to stomach. 
44,Saving Christmas,2.3,25,RogerEbert.com," Every holiday season sees a new influx of Christmas movies desperate to become the next big seasonal perennial destined to provide laughter, tears, humanity and healthy residuals for years to come. "
45,Saving Christmas,2.3,25,Washington Post, A glorified infomercial in defense of the holiday that contains about 15 minutes of actual content padded out with almost an hour of filler. 
46,Saving Christmas,2.3,20,Los Angeles Times, An unholy mess co-produced by Cameron's faith-based Camfam Studios. 
47,Saving Christmas,2.3,16,The A.V. Club," Preaching aside, though, Saving Christmas is a shoddy 80-minute feature that contains approximately 50 minutes of actual moving footage. When Cameron narrates that materialism doesn’t go against Christmas because it celebrates the son of God being made material himself, it sounds like a defense of any kind of cheap, poorly made holiday crap — this movie included. "
48,Saving Christmas,2.3,8,TheWrap," Director Doane offers no storytelling pizzazz; the lighting is careless, the pacing is deadly, the occasional stabs at comedy fall flat. Ultimately, Saving Christmas has nothing to share that Linus Van Pelt didn't already say better on “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” "
49,Son of the Mask,2.4,50,Entertainment Weekly," The characters twirl around like mini tornadoes, but between random brash moments of technological eye-tickling, Son of the Mask sags more than it spins. "
50,Son of the Mask,2.4,50,Miami Herald," In actuality, it's silly fun custom-tailored for reluctant young fathers and that entire clan of 20-something man-children who still read comic books and play video games, guys who do everything possible to resist the notion of adult responsibility. "
51,Son of the Mask,2.4,40,Village Voice," At its heart is a deep, unresolved ambivalence about child rearing. "
52,Son of the Mask,2.4,38,Chicago Tribune," Even with a new leading man and a more family-friendly rating, some things never change: The Mask still stars Industrial Light & Magic. "
53,Son of the Mask,2.4,30,Variety, The net result is a truly numbing experience. 
54,Son of the Mask,2.4,30,L.A. Weekly," Most of the animated sequences, capably mixed with live action, leave a bad aftertaste, particularly when the ultimate fate of one beaten and battered human bystander after another is left callously unresolved. In other words, parents beware. "
55,Son of the Mask,2.4,25,Christian Science Monitor, Cumming's antic acting is the only asset of this boisterous comedy. 
56,Son of the Mask,2.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Loud, mean-spirited and generally obnoxious, Son of the Mask makes the boisterous 1994 original look downright demure and refined. "
57,Son of the Mask,2.4,20,Dallas Observer, One presumes the only thing worse than making this disaster is actually watching it; wouldn't wish either on anyone. 
58,Son of the Mask,2.4,10,The New York Times," An irredeemable mess, a computer-animated Punch and Judy show without wit, heart or a single memorable performance. "
59,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,40,L.A. Weekly," Full of gumption, Clarkson and Guarini soldier on, seemingy unaware that the perfectly adequate singing voices that brought them to the big screen are being drowned out, on a half-dozen same-sounding songs, by an overlayered backup group. "
60,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,30,The New York Times," They play cotton candy effigies of themselves named Kelly and Justin, and the best that can be said is that they don't embarrass themselves. "
61,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,30,Variety," The most resounding thuds in From Justin to Kelly, however, come from the musical numbers. "
62,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,25,Miami Herald," A feather-light musical rushed into production to capitalize on American Idol-frenzy, is nothing more than an excuse to give the two leads several musical numbers, a la those Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" movies, and with just about the same amount of substance, too. "
63,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," In this frothy beach movie, they make pop-music lite together but create an utterly unconvincing romantic couple, seeming more like siblings or best friends. From Ruben to Clay might work better. "
64,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,25,New York Post, Arguably the most insipid movie released so far this century. 
65,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,20,Dallas Observer," Aspires to be a ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" redux with a gangbang Grease finale, but it plays like junior high Neil LaBute filmed by an elementary school AV squad. "
66,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,10,Film Threat," Just one of those films, a bottomless well of snark fodder that may come and go in theatres but will surely be spun innumerable times on DVD at parties in the years to come. "
67,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,0,The A.V. Club," More than anything, From Justin To Kelly needs Simon Cowell, the fork-tongued Idol judge who gives the show its only sliver of tension. "
68,From Justin to Kelly,2.4,0,New York Daily News," More than awful, more than dreadful, and easily the worst beach movie ever made. "
69,Epic Movie,2.4,40,The New York Times," The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score, by Edward Sheamur, is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up, as the White Bitch and Aslo the Lion, to add some easy, demented class. "
70,Epic Movie,2.4,30,Variety," If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, big studio Hollywood hitmakers should consider themselves lauded to the max in Jason Friedberg and Aaron Selzer's Epic Movie, the latest (and epically unfunny) entry in the movie parody franchise. "
71,Epic Movie,2.4,30,Chicago Reader," The cinematic equivalent of a tapeworm, this delivers few laughs beyond the initial chuckles of recognition. Seltzer and Friedberg (who also directed) have another script in development called ""Raunchy Movie""; apparently one idea they haven't yet considered is ""Watchable Movie."" "
72,Epic Movie,2.4,25,ReelViews," Epic Movie is a waste of time. It's like a bad issue of ""Cracked Magazine"" come to life. It's not so much painful as it is sleep inducing. "
73,Epic Movie,2.4,25,TV Guide Magazine," The sadists responsible for the painfully unfunny ""Date Movie"" (2006) are back, and this time they've outdone themselves: This theater-clearer is even less amusing than its terrible predecessor, a spoof so devoid of laughs it can longer be categorized as a comedy. "
74,Epic Movie,2.4,25,New York Daily News," Still, if it gets little else right, at least Epic Movie is accurately titled: It may be only 86 minutes long, but it feels as if it lasts forever. "
75,Epic Movie,2.4,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer must be stopped. For the last two years, this filmmaking team has created a series of spoof movies so feeble, shoddy and unfunny that they may be part of a diabolical, ""Manchurian Candidate""-like plot to stunt the intellectual development of American adolescents. "
76,Epic Movie,2.4,20,L.A. Weekly," By the time this dud drops on NetFlix, it'll be as obsolete as a Chia pet jokebook. "
77,Epic Movie,2.4,12,New York Post," This spoof of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and other recent blockbusters piles up sex gags, toilet gags and make-you-gag gags. "
78,Epic Movie,2.4,12,Boston Globe," The willful sloppiness and retrograde gags make Epic Movie, which was not shown to critics, an inevitable byproduct of our Internet video era. It seems downloaded and projected onto the screen, a failing online-film-school project paid for and put out by a Hollywood movie studio. That said, very little on YouTube is this unentertaining. "
79,Alone in the Dark,2.5,50,Los Angeles Times," Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns. "
80,Alone in the Dark,2.5,30,Dallas Observer, Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired. 
81,Alone in the Dark,2.5,30,Variety," Fans of the source material probably won't be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup, and non-fans definitely won't. "
82,Alone in the Dark,2.5,25,Chicago Tribune," That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay. "
83,Alone in the Dark,2.5,25,Charlotte Observer," Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn't be overtaxed. "
84,Alone in the Dark,2.5,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen. "
85,Alone in the Dark,2.5,25,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead"") has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it's time for him to close up shop. "
86,Alone in the Dark,2.5,10,The Hollywood Reporter, One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it's still really bad. 
87,Alone in the Dark,2.5,10,Washington Post," This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they're in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs. "
88,Alone in the Dark,2.5,0,The New York Times," So inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash. "
89,Battlefield Earth,2.6,50,Chicago Tribune," Scientology or not, the movie is a battlefield bummer that makes you want to revolt. "
90,Battlefield Earth,2.6,38,Boston Globe," So heavy and lifeless that you keep waiting for those three little front-row kibitzers from ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" to appear at the bottom of the screen to start goofing on it. "
91,Battlefield Earth,2.6,30,Salon," Shot after shot photographed at wobbly, off-center angles for no particular reason, weigh every action sequence down with super-slo-mo in lame imitation of ""The Matrix"" or end every single scene with a vertical wipe. "
92,Battlefield Earth,2.6,20,Variety," Yet the overall look, though derivative (""The Matrix,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Waterworld,"" etc.), rates as Battlefield's one non-guilty pleasure. "
93,Battlefield Earth,2.6,16,Portland Oregonian," A ghastly, unappealing mess that lacks a single absorbing character, engaging story line or entertaining snippet of dialogue. "
94,Battlefield Earth,2.6,10,Film.com," The film is Travolta's baby, but indifference and boredom is everywhere. "
95,Battlefield Earth,2.6,10,Newsweek," The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden, and Roger Christian's directing choices are a lesson in sci-fi film cliché. "
96,Battlefield Earth,2.6,10,TNT RoughCut, The only danger in seeing this film is in busting a gut at its unintentional hilarity. 
97,Battlefield Earth,2.6,0,Film.com," In the pantheon of cinematic train wrecks, from ""Ishtar"" to ""Waterworld,"" set a place at the table for Battlefield Earth. "
98,Battlefield Earth,2.6,0,Rolling Stone," With this kind of epic ineptitude -- hell, the flick is set in the year 3000 -- you go for ""worst of the millennium."" "
99,Glitter,2.6,60,Los Angeles Times," Glitter is the week's only major Hollywood release, and it offers considerable escapist entertainment while hitting an affirmative note. "
100,Glitter,2.6,40,L.A. Weekly," Glitter is, if nothing else, comfortable with what it is, namely earnestly made, wholehearted schlock. "
101,Glitter,2.6,38,New York Daily News," This is the worst performance by a pop star in a dramatic role since Madonna suited up for ""Shanghai Surprise."" "
102,Glitter,2.6,25,San Francisco Chronicle, It doesn't help that Glitter is such a derivative mishmash of cinematic and real-life situations that it's nearly impossible to count all the ways. 
103,Glitter,2.6,25,Entertainment Weekly," It's doubtful that even a real actress could have triumphed over the rusty tinsel of Glitter, a hapless, retro-'80s ''Star Is Born.'' "
104,Glitter,2.6,20,TV Guide Magazine," A butt-numbing exercise in tedium, sporadically redeemed by moments of unintentional hilarity. "
105,Glitter,2.6,12,Baltimore Sun, Glitter does no one any favors. 
106,Glitter,2.6,10,Variety," Glitter deserves yet another title: ""A Star Is Dull."" As phony a vehicle as one could possibly concoct for a wannabe movie star, pic carries Mariah Carey into a swamp of gloppy melodrama. "
107,Glitter,2.6,10,The New York Times," Mostly dross, an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clichés that illustrates the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication. "
108,Glitter,2.6,0,New Times (L.A.), Worst movie of the year. 
109,Gigli,2.6,58,Entertainment Weekly," A watchable bad movie, but it's far from your typical cookie-cutter blockbuster. There are no shoot-outs or car chases, and there isn't much romantic suspense, either. "
110,Gigli,2.6,40,The A.V. Club," Writer-director Martin Brest lends the film a professional sheen, and his stars (who some rumors suggest may have become romantically involved) have charisma to spare, but the film has all the charge and momentum of a Paxil ad. "
111,Gigli,2.6,40,Salon," Turns out to be merely bad -- not a train wreck, not the crime against humanity it's been rumored to be. "
112,Gigli,2.6,38,Charlotte Observer," After five minutes, Christopher Walken vanishes. We wait vainly for the next 90 minutes for someone, anyone to bring that kind of danger, unpredictability and vitality to a story as drab as army fatigues. "
113,Gigli,2.6,25,New York Post," The problem with Gigli is that it is an inept attempt to do Elmore Leonard by Martin Brest, a filmmaker whose coarse sensibility makes him catastrophically unqualified to the task. "
114,Gigli,2.6,25,Baltimore Sun, Excruciating...The movie proves to be singularly unfunny and static almost from the non-get-go. Virtually nothing happens; the movie is all premise. 
115,Gigli,2.6,25,New York Daily News, Gigli is a disaster. 
116,Gigli,2.6,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," A hypnotic, black hole of a movie that sucks reputations, careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesn't star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded preening and bungled humour. "
117,Gigli,2.6,0,Wall Street Journal," The worst movie -- all right, the worst allegedly major movie -- of our admittedly young century. More stupefying follies may come, but it's impossible to imagine how they'll beat this one for staggering idiocy, fatuousness or pretension. "
118,Gigli,2.6,0,San Francisco Chronicle," The most thoroughly joyless and inept film of the year, and one of the worst of the decade. We're talking about a disaster, and not of the fun ""Showgirls"" variety, either. "
119,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,70,The New York Times," May or may not appeal to fans of the Japanese fantasy franchise it is based on, but aficionados of apocalyptic teenybopper kung fu extravaganzas are in for a real treat. "
120,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,70,Village Voice," Far more entertaining than it deserves to be, unless you're a 10-year-old boy, in which case it's only the greatest movie ever made. "
121,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,50,Variety," A popular Japanese manga series gets a pleasing if paint-by-numbers live-action makeover in Dragonball Evolution, which half-heartedly tries to keep the faith for its pubescent male fanbase. "
122,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,50,Entertainment Weekly, Marvel at the fact that something this trippy made it to our local multiplex. 
123,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,50,Boston Globe," Nearly all the actors seem to be having a good time, and the action moves so fast that you don't mind when something nuts happens. "
124,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,42,The A.V. Club," The film is crammed with treats for old-school ""Dragonball"" fans, from the inclusion of all these characters (who don't actually do much) to the moment when spiky-haired Goku dons his orange gi. For everyone else, this amounts to another seen-it-before, probably-willing-to-see-it-again distraction. "
125,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,40,Los Angeles Times," Director James Wong (""Final Destination"") and writer Ben Ramsey are utterly blasé in their approach to the series' mythology and structure, cobbling together an 84-minute movie that seems to exist only to rile up fanboys. On that count -- and that count alone -- Dragonball Evolution triumphs. "
126,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,40,Austin Chronicle," Bottom line: costumed Goku and Chi Chi cosplayers may argue the finer points of this adaptation, but it is fairly dazzling it its own overextended, futurist-teenpulp fashion, and Chow makes a vastly more entertaining Roshi than he did a King. "
127,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,38,TV Guide Magazine," Just know there's a whole lot more great stuff out there than just what Evolution has in store for you -- namely, the anime that it was based on. "
128,Dragonball Evolution,2.7,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Completely lacking in visual, narrative or stylistic coherence, the film also suffers from cheap-looking visual effects and poorly staged and edited action sequences that will not exactly please the fanboys. "
129,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,42,The A.V. Club," The tired racial stereotypes that Caddy inserts into the old Caddyshack-style ""slobs vs. snobs"" formula should probably make it much more offensive than it is. "
130,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,40,Variety, An instantly forgettable trifle. 
131,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,38,New York Daily News, His C-Note is essentially a one-note character. And that note is flat. 
132,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Ultimately this is utterly forgettable stuff, not even managing to fulfill its mandate of mindless summer fun. "
133,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,30,L.A. Weekly," No, it’s not Caddyshack -- just swap Jews (Rodney Dangerfield) for blacks (Big Boi) and you’ve got Who’s Your Caddy?. The movie, of course, is terrible. "
134,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,30,The New York Times, There’s probably more wit and pointed social commentary in the average four-minute OutKast song than in the entirety of Who’s Your Caddy? 
135,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,12,Boston Globe," As it develops, Who's Your Caddy? just becomes depressing. You want to alert the United Negro College Fund: A mind has terribly gone to waste. "
136,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,11,Austin Chronicle, Must be counted as a forfeit. 
137,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,0,Film Threat, The sport of golf has seen its fair share of vulgar comedies over the last 30 years or so. 
138,Who's Your Caddy?,2.8,0,Washington Post," An offensive, comedy-free comedy. "
139,Meet the Spartans,2.8,58,Entertainment Weekly," Less classic Mel Brooks than middling ""Best Week Ever."" "
140,Meet the Spartans,2.8,38,Boston Globe," The best thing in Meet the Spartans is the swift kick in the bombast it delivers to the oh-no-not-us homoeroticism of ""300."" "
141,Meet the Spartans,2.8,25,TV Guide Magazine," The musical number that runs during the closing credits funnier than anything that precedes it, which isn't saying much. "
142,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer basically reprise the tired formula from their earlier efforts, which is to throw in as many pop culture references as possible to cover up the lack of any real wit. "
143,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,The New York Times, Overkill is what Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer do best: as the uncontested titans of the parody genre (with fingers in everything from the “Scary Movie” franchise to the more recent “Epic Movie”) they continue to prove that ridiculing other movies is much easier than making your own. 
144,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,L.A. Weekly," Meet the Spartans is a mild improvement over their ""Epic Movie,"" which is like saying that a debilitating fever is more fun than appendicitis, but what’s shocking is how lazy it is, which is a shame for former UK child star/pop singer Sean Maguire, whose Gerard Butler impersonation is spot-on. "
145,Meet the Spartans,2.8,10,Variety," Lazy, lame and painfully unfunny, Meet the Spartans is yet another scrambled-genre parody. "
146,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,The A.V. Club," Meet The Spartans gamely alternates between unfunny gay jokes and violent pratfalls for a good 80 minutes, finding time for not one, but two musical dance numbers set to ""I Will Survive."" "
147,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,Village Voice," Witless, tasteless, formless spoof. "
148,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,Austin Chronicle," Hey, guys, when you repurpose a disco hit to poke fun at gay men, not only do you look like assholes, you look like assholes who rip their jokes off of YouTube. "
149,Baby Geniuses,2.9,40,Film Threat, This movie wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It's still not that good though. 
150,Baby Geniuses,2.9,38,Chicago Sun-Times," Bad films are easy to make, but a film as unpleasant as Baby Geniuses' achieves a kind of grandeur. "
151,Baby Geniuses,2.9,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), About as endearing as unanesthetized gum surgery. 
152,Baby Geniuses,2.9,10,Chicago Reader, The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring. 
153,Baby Geniuses,2.9,10,L.A. Weekly," There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs. "
154,Baby Geniuses,2.9,10,Variety," A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film that proves you shouldn't beat a dead horse. "
155,Baby Geniuses,2.9,0,Entertainment Weekly, The worst movie of 1999. 
156,Baby Geniuses,2.9,0,The New York Times," One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close. "
157,Baby Geniuses,2.9,0,San Francisco Chronicle, A stupid comedy with toddlers talking like hip '90s grown-ups. 
158,Baby Geniuses,2.9,0,Austin Chronicle, Trying to encapsulate the movie's storyline is not possible; it doesn't appear to have one. 
159,Date Movie,2.9,30,The New York Times," Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who wrote the screenplay, have crammed dozens of movie parodies into this deliberately juvenile spoof of romantic comedies. Mr. Seltzer, who directed, has made very few of them funny. "
160,Date Movie,2.9,30,L.A. Weekly," This anemic genre parody from two of the six writers of ""Scary Movie"" strives for the goofball precision of the brothers Zucker and, long before it reaches the end of its 70-odd minutes, gives you newfound respect for the comic genius of the brothers Wayans (two of the other writers of ""Scary Movie""). "
161,Date Movie,2.9,25,San Francisco Chronicle, A lame pastiche of Hollywood romances. 
162,Date Movie,2.9,25,TV Guide Magazine," The choice is yours: Shell out 10 bucks for this dire spoof of recent romantic comedies a la ""Scary Movie"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie"", or toss your 12-year-old nephew a quarter and get him to act out scenes from his favorite movies for 80 minutes: The entertainment value will be about the same. "
163,Date Movie,2.9,20,Variety," Arguably the lamest of all the free-wheeling genre parodies that have taken flight since ""Airplane!,"" Date Movie is stupefyingly unfunny in its attempts to mock romantic comedies, celebrities, reality TV shows and anything else that pops into the heads of its creators. "
164,Date Movie,2.9,20,Los Angeles Times, The only thing remotely resembling parody in this depressing waste of time and money is Jennifer Coolidge's sendup of Barbra Streisand as an over-the-top string of Jewish mother clichés. 
165,Date Movie,2.9,0,New York Daily News," ""Comedy is hard,"" said Steve Martin. For the writers of Date Movie, it's apparently impossible. "
166,Date Movie,2.9,0,New York Post," A collection of throwaway gags from other movies, a big blue recycling barrel of comedy waiting for the trash collector. It's rated PG-13 because 13 is the maximum age of those who might find it funny. "
167,Date Movie,2.9,0,Film Threat, Elapsed time before I walked out: 29 minutes Total laughs (in that period): 0 
168,Date Movie,2.9,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Date Movie is a good date movie in one sense: If you're still speaking to the person who brought you to see this, you just might have a future together. "
169,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,30,The New York Times," Lorraine Gary has some affecting moments as Ellen, but Jaws the Revenge is mild and predictable, the very things an adventure movie should never be. "
170,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Jaws the Revenge is not simply a bad movie, but also a stupid and incompetent one - a ripoff. "
171,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,25,Chicago Reader," Angry fish travels to the Bahamas for the Christmas holidays, plotting revenge against the family of a vacationing New England widow (Lorraine Gary). Noel, noel, a charming gift idea with suggestions of inverted seasonal myth—until director Joseph Sargent swamps it all in antimythical literalism and predictable lunchtime theater. "
172,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,Empire," Significantly worse than the rest of the series, this film is one of the worst flops in recent cinema. "
173,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,Time Out London," While it's mostly just a matter of waiting till feeding time, there is a hint that somebody was trying to foist some Symbolism onto the shark: as mother and son suffer an attack of the Oedipals, the creature keeps popping up grinning. Sadly, this attempt at a bit of Art (which could have had hilarious consequences) is ditched, and the film concludes with a few people getting chewed before a messy happy ending amid chunks of exploding shark. "
174,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,TV Guide Magazine," Even the special effects are lame in this one, offering a latex shark that is about as realistic as a fake goldfish. Poorly directed by Joseph Sargent, who relies heavily on blood and fast editing to create tension since there certainly isn't any written into the script. "
175,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,Variety," Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine. "
176,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,Los Angeles Times," In a wicked mess of unmatched water shots and dreadful interior airplane sequences, the characters outlined in little blue halos, the performances range from the mortifying to the merely immemorable. Against all odds, Lance Guest and Karen Young manage to be warm and credible. Podgy but game, Michael Caine, bravely attempts mouth-to-mouth resusitation on a role which is little more than anecdotes strung together. It is not his finest hour. "
177,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,20,Washington Post," The director, Joseph Sargent, doesn't bring out any of the possibilities in the material -- not even the scary ones. And Michael Caine is wasted, though not completely. He manages to provide at least a little suspense, even if it's the extracurricular sort, by raising the question: Will an Oscar winner be allowed to become fish food? "
178,Jaws: The Revenge,3.1,10,Washington Post," There's more suspense in On Golden Pond. And when the predictable ending comes, it has none of the titanic man-versus-beast struggle of the original. It all happens so quickly, you wonder if you've missed something. But, no you haven't, because there it is -- the familiar calm sea . . . of credits. "
179,BloodRayne,3.1,40,L.A. Weekly," There are all sorts of noteworthy people in this silly vampire epic, including acting greats Sir Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin, but the only artist this critic wants to heap praise upon is the regrettably unidentified Supervisor of Blood Splatter: Nice work, dude. "
180,BloodRayne,3.1,40,Los Angeles Times," The only thing left unsliced is the ham in BloodRayne, yet another video game adaptation by German genre specialist Uwe Boll and a movie with more fading - or faded - talent than an Italian basketball team. "
181,BloodRayne,3.1,33,The A.V. Club," With minimal flare and maximal gore, Boll simply delivers the turgid drama and incompetently staged action sequences that have made him the unstoppable Big Boss of the gaming community. "
182,BloodRayne,3.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Attention, Ben Kingsley (I mean, Sir Ben Kingsley): It's officially time to turn in your Oscar. "
183,BloodRayne,3.1,25,Premiere, Yet another ill-conceived big screen videogame adaptation. 
184,BloodRayne,3.1,25,TV Guide Magazine, Why do moviegoers and gamers keep going to see video-game-based movies when neither group is ever happy with the results? 
185,BloodRayne,3.1,25,New York Daily News," While there's no fun in mediocrity, ludicrousness is another matter. Boll is the best at what he does, and what he does is make truly terrible films. "
186,BloodRayne,3.1,25,New York Post, Semicoherent. 
187,BloodRayne,3.1,20,Variety, Anemic action-fantasy. 
188,BloodRayne,3.1,0,Austin Chronicle," Maybe everyone involved was hoping that no one would see this movie, but Madsen is the only one who should fear anyone seeing his work. "
189,Kazaam,3.2,50,San Francisco Examiner," The movie is decidedly old-fashioned, aiming to send kids and their parents out of the theater feeling good about themselves. "
190,Kazaam,3.2,38,Chicago Sun-Times," As for Shaquille O'Neal, given his own three wishes the next time, he should go for a script, a director and an interesting character. "
191,Kazaam,3.2,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Is Kazaam racist? In effect, yes. But it'sracism linked to bad marketing: You can't really mix a black-pride rap film with a revamped version of ""Free Willie"" and expect them to magically jibe. "
192,Kazaam,3.2,33,Entertainment Weekly, It takes the movie all of 15 minutes to descend into sub-Spielbergian banalities about poor Max's search for his absentee dad. 
193,Kazaam,3.2,30,Los Angeles Times, The odd truth is that the film's novice star is better than the material. 
194,Kazaam,3.2,30,The New York Times, Memo to Shaquille O'Neal: Don't give up your night job. 
195,Kazaam,3.2,25,Christian Science Monitor," The plot is hamstrung by trite formulas, and there's too much violence and family tension for very young viewers. Shaquille O'Neal is likable as the title character, though. "
196,Kazaam,3.2,25,ReelViews," This is as witless as movies come -- an unamusing, moronic blend of horrible acting and inept screenwriting. "
197,Kazaam,3.2,25,San Francisco Chronicle," Original enough to come up with new ways to go wrong. For one, the film is a blatant showcase to promote O'Neal as a rap artist. "
198,Kazaam,3.2,0,Austin Chronicle," It's full of special effects that are big on smoke and noise, but short on logic and payoff. "
199,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,42,IndieWire," The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) is just as repulsive, but far louder, and in color. "
200,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,30,Village Voice," Tom Six's threequel races to the bottom with abandon, all while indulging in tired wink-wink self-consciousness that includes Six himself showing up to witness his movie monster made real (and to be slandered by Laser as ""a poop-infatuated toddler""). "
201,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,20,New York Daily News," Neither Scary nor eye-rollingly fun, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) is the dullest entry in an atrocious trilogy. "
202,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,10,Variety," Six just wants to shock, though his imagination is so primitive that the effort is strained and a bit pathetic. Initially abrasive, the whole enterprise grows simply tedious well before the now-epically-scaled titular phenom is unveiled in the prison yard. "
203,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,Slant Magazine," Tom Six has achieved the seemingly impossible: He's made a film even less watchable than ""The Human Centipede II."" "
204,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,TheWrap," The thing that wrecks The Human Centipede III isn’t how the film is disgustingly, degradingly unclean; instead, Six’s work is ruined by how his film is desperately, depressingly unclever. "
205,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,The Dissolve, It’s only fitting that a series that began with the concept of linking the digestive tracts of three people would end by feasting on its own shit. 
206,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,The A.V. Club," The gross-out gore scenes and poop jokes are there, too, as is to be expected. The direction is bad, the acting is worse, and it’s lit to mimic the soap-opera effect on a poorly calibrated HDTV. Basically, The Human Centipede III is an unsexy ""Ilsa"" movie, and it’s just as impossible to sit through as that sounds. "
207,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,Entertainment Weekly," Even by the series’ already low standards, The Human Centipede Part 3 is crap. "
208,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),3.2,0,Los Angeles Times," As horror, it's frightless and boring. As comedy, it's desperate and laughless. As exploitation, it's exceedingly dull. Even excrement was once something of substance. The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence is just rancid air. It too shall pass. "
209,Rollerball,3.3,50,New York Daily News," The game itself is meaningless, and the movie, much the same way, likes it like that. "
210,Rollerball,3.3,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), What's up with director John McTiernan? The man has got to get a career of his own -- sponging off the pale leavings of Norman Jewison just won't do. 
211,Rollerball,3.3,30,Los Angeles Times," It's too bad this Rollerball veered off-track so swiftly, derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking. "
212,Rollerball,3.3,25,Baltimore Sun, There's something junior varsity about the whole sensibility that makes the new version seem more dated than the old one. 
213,Rollerball,3.3,20,The New York Times," The current version, however, like its predecessor, fails as entertainment. Mr. McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious. "
214,Rollerball,3.3,20,The A.V. Club," Only those attracted to ""Waterworld"" or ""Last Action Hero"" level big-budget disasters need bother with this one. "
215,Rollerball,3.3,12,Chicago Sun-Times," An incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense. "
216,Rollerball,3.3,10,Film Threat, Will surely end up as one of this year’s worst films. 
217,Rollerball,3.3,0,Miami Herald," Plentiful helpings of dreadful acting, confusing action cinematography, choppy editing and embarrassing dialogue, with the added bonus of a plot almost as dumb as that of the original film. "
218,Rollerball,3.3,0,Variety," Sheer chaos on wheels, a hysterically edited jumble that defies belief at nearly every juncture. "
219,Left Behind,3.3,50,The Dissolve, The film’s appeal is largely dependent on Cage; Left Behind is a batshit-crazy Cage cult classic of a radically new stripe. 
220,Left Behind,3.3,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," It’s inoffensive, unless you take umbrage at the idea that the only people who know not to steal are True Believers and all that keeps society from an instant meltdown are the Faithful. "
221,Left Behind,3.3,35,TheWrap, Has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and production values that verge on parody. 
222,Left Behind,3.3,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The Rapture won’t come soon enough for the unfortunate souls forced to suffer through Left Behind. 
223,Left Behind,3.3,25,San Francisco Chronicle," That lack of concern for the way people actually interact renders the film useless as entertainment, or as a conversion tool. "
224,Left Behind,3.3,16,The A.V. Club," This Left Behind may be worse than the last Left Behind, but it’s much less boring, thanks in part to the commitment of its star, who plays the often ludicrous material with the straightest of faces. The Cage works in mysterious ways. "
225,Left Behind,3.3,10,Variety," With a “Sharknado”-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage, Left Behind is cheap-looking, overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order. "
226,Left Behind,3.3,0,New York Daily News," This failed epic — really, an epic failure — would barely be noticed, were it not for former Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage taking on a “Sharknado”-quality remake of a Kirk Cameron movie. "
227,Left Behind,3.3,0,Chicago Tribune," Cage is going for manly, if conflicted, family-guy confidence in this role, but somehow it comes off as nuttier than the events surrounding him. "
228,Left Behind,3.3,0,Entertainment Weekly," At best, Left Behind is shoddily made sensationalist propaganda — with atrocious acting — that barely registers as entertainment. At worst, it's profoundly moronic. "
229,Bratz,3.4,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Finally, a postfeminist multicultural musical extravaganza for 8-year-old girls. Is Bratz not the most totally stylin' movie ever? Grownups won't think so, but for their daughters who share a ""passion for fashion"" with the dolls that are giving Barbie a run for her money, it will be the event of the season. "
230,Bratz,3.4,42,Entertainment Weekly," A movie based on a doll line, is an M&M-colored high school fantasia for aspirational 10- and 12-year-old girls who'll be shocked (or, hopefully, delighted) when they get to ninth grade and find out life isn't so super-Bratz-fabulous. "
231,Bratz,3.4,42,The A.V. Club, Bratz's strong anti-clique sermonizing would be slightly more convincing if it weren't tethered to a movie romanticizing the most awesome clique ever. 
232,Bratz,3.4,40,Variety," Bratz’s references and parodies are consistently on-target, if always way too over-the-top. Every line of dialogue could plausibly take an exclamation point. "
233,Bratz,3.4,40,Washington Post," This is a movie for a grade-schooler's -- a female grade-schooler's -- sensibility. It's earnest, silly and sweet, with just enough food fights and musical numbers to keep everyone else from gagging on the goo. "
234,Bratz,3.4,38,USA Today, A silly movie that's essentially a series of clichés strung together into a semblance of a movie. 
235,Bratz,3.4,30,Village Voice," In the end, the most offensive part of Bratz isn't its stereotypes or brand expansion; it's the sorry state of Jon Voight's career. "
236,Bratz,3.4,30,Austin Chronicle, Bratz is way too long. 
237,Bratz,3.4,30,Los Angeles Times, It's a movie on the wrong side side of the so-bad-it's-good line. 
238,Bratz,3.4,0,Chicago Tribune," The most horrifying film of 2007, Bratz is based on the popular line of collagen-lipped, doe-eyed slut-ette dolls and their male companions, ""the boys with a passion for fashion ... and the Bratz!"" (In other words, they're bi-curious.) "
239,Catwoman,3.4,67,Entertainment Weekly," I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed. "
240,Catwoman,3.4,50,Dallas Observer," Much like a cat, the movie is a superfluous gob of fluff with an attitude ranging from idiotic to nasty. "
241,Catwoman,3.4,38,Philadelphia Inquirer," Catwoman, which talks about the ""duality"" inside all women (wild vs. docile, rapacious vs. cuddly), does have its guilty pleasures. Most of these come courtesy of ice queen Stone. "
242,Catwoman,3.4,30,Village Voice," Like the action movies of yore (you know, the 1980s), Catwoman is simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished. "
243,Catwoman,3.4,30,The New York Times," A howlingly silly, moderately diverting exercise in high, pointless style. "
244,Catwoman,3.4,30,L.A. Weekly," What the movie needs is a director, and what it gets instead is Pitof, a French visual-effects maestro so much fonder of technological wizardry than of human flesh that he manages to turn even his slinky, sinuous star attraction into a digitized synthespian frolicking about endless CGI cityscapes. "
245,Catwoman,3.4,25,ReelViews, A catastrophe. This motion picture is an embarrassment to all involved. 
246,Catwoman,3.4,25,Charlotte Observer," Pitof can be blamed for the 89-cent digitized sets, the jerky or rubbery special effects, some clunky performances and more continuity errors than I could count. "
247,Catwoman,3.4,25,Christian Science Monitor, Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip. 
248,Catwoman,3.4,25,Miami Herald," Silly, tedious, inept disaster. "
249,Jack and Jill,3.4,63,Boston Globe," What's more genuinely wacky is what a kick the movie can sometimes be, completely in spite of its big, flat stunt. "
250,Jack and Jill,3.4,40,New York Daily News," There are moments in Jack and Jill that are genuinely funny - and, just like countless family reunions, there are moments when you can't wait for it to end. "
251,Jack and Jill,3.4,38,Orlando Sentinel," Then there's Pacino, out-of-place and yet somehow right at home. You want big? Al does BIG. And since is as close as we're likely to get to ""Don Corleone Does Don Quixote,"" that alone is worth the price of admission. "
252,Jack and Jill,3.4,30,The New York Times," There are a few funny moments in Jack and Jill, most of them celebrity cameos that also serve to affirm what a cool, connected celebrity Mr. Sandler is. The most sustained of these is the appearance of Al Pacino as himself, falling for Jill and giving the film a jolt of genuine zaniness. I'm sorry to say that this may be Mr. Pacino's most convincing performance in years. "
253,Jack and Jill,3.4,25,Miami Herald, Jack and Jill contains long stretches of squirm-inducing tedium in which Sandler riffs and ad-libs far longer than he should. 
254,Jack and Jill,3.4,25,Washington Post," The unapologetic laziness and ineptitude of Jack's impersonation, which is played for cheap laughs, is just as lazy as Sandler's performance as the real Jill. You don't buy it for a minute. "
255,Jack and Jill,3.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Jack and Jill is witless and sloppily constructed, getting by on fart gags, homeless jokes, Latino stereotypes and that old favorite, explosive chimichanga diarrhea -- and no, not in an inspired ""Bridesmaids"" way. "
256,Jack and Jill,3.4,12,Slant Magazine," If the result is a movie that seems like a much slicker, more condensed, and speedier version of the Sandler comedies that have guaranteed his grandkids' retirement, count it as a blessing that it's over quickly. Not without pain, but quickly. "
257,Jack and Jill,3.4,12,USA Today," A comedy that has one good joke, four strange cameos and a spirit so juvenile kids may wonder what Sandler's deal is. "
258,Jack and Jill,3.4,0,Rolling Stone," A total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement. "
259,The Emoji Movie,3.4,40,Variety," There have been worse ideas, but in this case the execution isn’t good enough to bring the notion of an emoji movie to funky, surprising life. "
260,The Emoji Movie,3.4,30,The Hollywood Reporter," If not always imaginative or digestible, the look of the settings and characters should keep kids awake for 86 minutes; and if the trick that eventually saves the day makes very little sense to critical moviegoers, at least it's cutely frantic eye candy. "
261,The Emoji Movie,3.4,25,IndieWire, The most distressing aspect about The Emoji Movie is that a spectacle this self-evidently soulless no longer feels like a new low. It doesn’t even leave a dent. 
262,The Emoji Movie,3.4,25,The A.V. Club," There was probably never going to be a version of this film that would prove even remotely plausible as a movie someone felt passionately about making for artistic reasons; as far as expanding on smartphone-related IP, this is an even weaker starting point than Sony Animation’s recent The Angry Birds Movie. "
263,The Emoji Movie,3.4,10,ScreenCrush," There are plenty of words that can describe The Emoji Movie. Here are a few of them: Unfunny. Saccharine. Nonsensical. Painful. And, of course, crappy. (If you prefer the poop emoji, that works too.) "
264,The Emoji Movie,3.4,10,Screen International," A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps — and nowhere near as addictive — Sony’s animated The Emoji Movie is a calamitous comedy that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy. "
265,The Emoji Movie,3.4,10,Vox," The Emoji Movie is a waste of time, resources, and a bunch of comedians’ voices, plus a premise that actually had the potential to do some small good in the world. It’s less of a movie and more of an insult. "
266,The Emoji Movie,3.4,0,TheWrap," It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being. "
267,The Emoji Movie,3.4,0,New York Daily News, The only thing worse than the dialogue is the absurd product placement. 
268,The Emoji Movie,3.4,0,New York Magazine (Vulture)," It is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children. "
269,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,80,Los Angeles Times," Exceptionally well-made family entertainment, this 3 Ninjas is constantly inventive, action-filled and funny, with a flourish of good special effects. "
270,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,58,The A.V. Club," The incredible silliness doesn’t quite erase the bad taste of this kid’s movie featuring an implied dozen civilian casualties, but it helps. "
271,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Pathetic yet stupidly entertaining for several minutes of its interminable running time, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain makes half its cast look like retreads and half like fresh ponies desperately karate-kicking a dud script to see if it has any signs of life. "
272,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,40,The New York Times," For most moviegoers over 12, this, the fourth Three Ninjas movie, will be interminably boring. But it's possible that young children will enjoy the film, since it falls into both the action category and the children-are-smart-adults-can't-do-anything-right genre. "
273,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,38,New York Post," As the fourth entry of a painfully uninspired series, this version features new actors portraying the trio of adolescent warriors. [10 Apr 1998, p.49] "
274,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,30,Variety, Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness in 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. 
275,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,3.4,25,TV Guide Magazine, The best you can say is that it's all pretty harmless and pretty stupid. 
276,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,42,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," This belabored summertime sequel is moderately less vulgar, certainly less expensive and, if possible, even less funny than its forerunning bomb, ""Daddy Day Care."" "
277,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,38,Miami Herald, A tired and unnecessary sequel. 
278,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,38,TV Guide Magazine," This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now-grown star of ""The Wonder Years,"" though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision. "
279,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,38,Boston Globe, Innocuous amusement for 5- to 8-year-olds and other people stuck in the anal stage of development. 
280,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Any scrap of charm or honest-to-goodness humor already possessed in limited quantities by the original has been relegated to the outhouse in this sorry follow-up. 
281,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,30,Variety," This sequel to the 2003 Eddie Murphy comedy may appeal to auds still young enough not to have seen it all before, or who still find flatulence hilarious, or who think adults, when agitated, flail about like epileptic marionettes. "
282,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,30,The New York Times," A recruiting poster for kids, insisting that there’s no domestic problem that military values can’t solve. "
283,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,25,New York Daily News," If you're looking for a modern-day ""Meatballs"" - or, for that matter, ""Meatballs 4"" - you're out of luck. "
284,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,25,San Francisco Chronicle," Too predictable, but kids should like it. "
285,Daddy Day Camp,3.4,12,New York Post," A comedy for no ages, has an amazing amount of CGI - Cuba Gooding Incompetence. "
286,Barb Wire,3.5,70,Washington Post," David Hogan keeps the action moving and loaded with fights, gun battles and other action-trashy thrills. Lee is terrific. "
287,Barb Wire,3.5,70,Washington Post," Lee elevates herself from the lower echelon of mere international super-babedom to the loftier realm of pulp myth. She is ""It"" with an exclamation mark. "
288,Barb Wire,3.5,63,Chicago Sun-Times," The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. Barb Wire has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun. "
289,Barb Wire,3.5,50,Austin Chronicle," It's a comic book movie in the broadest sense of the term, and although it's neither as emotionally resonant as ""The Crow"" nor as surreally goofy as ""Tank Girl,"" Barb Wire still manages to get you going, Anderson Lee fan or not. "
290,Barb Wire,3.5,40,Los Angeles Times," Ought to be disreputable fun. Instead it ends up, all its explosions and exposed flesh notwithstanding, rather inert. "
291,Barb Wire,3.5,40,The New York Times, Isn't much when it comes to either deliberate or inadvertent humor. But it does have a few amusing moments. 
292,Barb Wire,3.5,40,Chicago Reader," Its main source is a comic book, but it might as well be a computer. "
293,Barb Wire,3.5,25,ReelViews," The element of high camp that makes for enjoyable ""good trash"" isn't present. "
294,Barb Wire,3.5,25,San Francisco Chronicle," A convoluted mess, but there have been worse. "
295,Barb Wire,3.5,25,San Francisco Examiner, Muddled futuristic thriller. 
296,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,100,San Francisco Chronicle," A flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the two other Chainsaw sequels seem like After-School Specials. [20 May 1995, p.E6] "
297,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,75,Chicago Sun-Times," Nothing at all is surprising about Next Generation except how enjoyable it is. It won't become a classic, but is quite a hoot, like the cockamamie Motel Hell, as funny as it is frightening. [29 Aug 1997, p.32] "
298,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,63,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," The other thing that sets this movie apart from the current crop of tongue-in-cheek screamers (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream) is that it's actually perversely intriguing, rather than just clever. [03 Nov 1997, p.C2] "
299,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,60,Variety, Manages the difficult feat of being genuinely scary and sharply self-satirical all at once. 
300,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,50,Austin Chronicle," Bits and pieces of the story will, on occasion, leave you scratching your head but it, nevertheless, moves rapidly enough to keep you scurrying to keep pace with the new business at hand. "
301,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,50,The New York Times," Its own efforts to be tongue-in-cheek, as with a backwoods gunman who quotes Emerson and Machiavelli, fall seriously flat. But should anyone have the patience to look closely, the two leading players do show signs of what would soon make them famous. "
302,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,50,TV Guide Magazine," Henkel's directing debut isn't incompetent: It's just derivative, pointless and tediously repetitive. "
303,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,50,The A.V. Club, A slightly above-average slasher film that's only partially redeemed by small but endearingly loopy shreds of black humor. 
304,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,42,Entertainment Weekly," The movie recapitulates the absurdist tabloid-redneck comedy of the great, original Chainsaw without a hint of its primal terror. "
305,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.5,40,Film Threat, The bottom line is that the only Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie that you need is to see is the first. 
306,Vampires Suck,3.5,42,Tampa Bay Times," After a lucrative career of bashing well-made scary, epic, disaster and date movies, Friedberg and Seltzer have a source begging to be mocked. "
307,Vampires Suck,3.5,40,The New York Times," This pointless parody dumps us in the fictional town of Sporks, Wash., a location lousy with vampires and werewolves. "
308,Vampires Suck,3.5,30,Boxoffice Magazine," As if a string of bad jokes wasn't enough, Vampires Suck is full of distractingly forced pop culture references and shameless product placements (the actors practically mug for the camera while holding various products). "
309,Vampires Suck,3.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," The main performers do a reasonably good job of parodying the ""Twilight"" leads, with Proske particularly effective in subtly lampooning Kristen Stewart's moody mannerisms. "
310,Vampires Suck,3.5,30,Arizona Republic," Two very important things to note about Vampires Suck: The film is a spoof of the ""Twilight"" movies, and the title is a good indication of where the level of wit lies. "
311,Vampires Suck,3.5,25,Orlando Sentinel," If Kristen Stewart ever saw Vampires Suck, she'd be scarred for life. "
312,Vampires Suck,3.5,25,San Francisco Chronicle, That Vampires Suck is a step above god-awful is something of a miracle. 
313,Vampires Suck,3.5,25,The A.V. Club," The boys similarly deserve very minor props for choosing a satirical target that lends itself to satire: the glum, self-important Twilight novels and movies. Sadly, that's where the filmmakers' mild accomplishments end and the groaningly predictable hackwork begins. "
314,Vampires Suck,3.5,20,Variety," The lame mediocrity of Vampires Suck undeniably reps an advance for writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By just about any other standard, however, this instantly forgettable trifle is fairly close to worthless. "
315,Vampires Suck,3.5,12,Washington Post," Vampires suck? That's a matter of opinion. But here's what inarguably, unequivocally does suck: Vampires Suck. "
316,Slender Man,3.5,65,IGN," If the story behind this chilling internet creation could have matched the quality of those aforementioned strong points, Sony would have a real horror gem on their hands. "
317,Slender Man,3.5,42,The A.V. Club," In a movie this flat-out dull, even a tasteful lack of direct exploitation feels like a failure of nerve. "
318,Slender Man,3.5,40,Time Out, Give this literally and figuratively bloodless spooker a pass. 
319,Slender Man,3.5,40,Arizona Republic," The movie is a big disappointment, because ultimately Slender Man does not get the full-on creep-out treatment such an intriguing character deserves. Here he's just a generic horror bad guy, doing standard horror-bad-guy things. He could be anything, really, and therefore winds up, like the movie, being not much. "
320,Slender Man,3.5,38,Chicago Tribune," Birke's script is plainly straightforward, a simple supernatural chase story. It doesn't plumb the depths of what might make Slender Man scary, so Slender Man isn't scary at all. "
321,Slender Man,3.5,38,Movie Nation," Give White credit for the picture’s fairly eerie tone and look — darkened streets, foggy forests of spindly pines, shadows and more shadows. It’s just not worth more than the occasional hair-raising instant. "
322,Slender Man,3.5,38,RogerEbert.com," Sporadically, one can see the movie that Slender Man could have been, but it disappears like the title character’s victims. "
323,Slender Man,3.5,30,Variety," Slender Man is the kind of movie in which images come before logic, because there really isn’t much logic. There’s just a movie out to goose you. "
324,Slender Man,3.5,25,IndieWire," A tasteless and incredibly undercooked serving of the internet’s stalest Creepypasta, Slender Man aspires to be for the YouTube era what “The Ring” was to the last gasps of the VHS generation...there’s one fundamental difference that sets the two movies apart: “The Ring” is good, and Slender Man is terrible. "
325,Slender Man,3.5,20,The New York Times, The most perfunctory horror picture I’ve seen in some time. 
326,Hercules in New York,3.5,38,USA Today," This unearthed cheapie and fast-forwarder's delight is redeemed by the dubbed- in cathedral tones (they're vintage gladiator pic) coming from our hero's larnyx. [20 Dec 1991, p.3D] "
327,Hercules in New York,3.5,25,TV Guide Magazine," For some reason, producer Wisberg decided to revive the long dead Hercules craze, and luckily it didn't take. "
328,Hercules in New York,3.5,25,Boston Globe," When you become a megastar like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you must expect your past to jump up and bite you - especially if you've made a stinker like this one. A great rental for frat parties, this Manhattan melodrama features Zeus sending Arnold, as Hercules, to present-day New York. [06 Dec 1991, p.62] "
329,Hercules in New York,3.5,25,Washington Post," It's a comedy to be laughed at rather than with, largely because the producers decided to dub Arnold's Teutonic voice with that of another actor, one who sounds like he's giving bus departure announcements at the Port Authority Terminal. [30 Jan 1992, p.C7] "
330,Spice World,3.6,100,San Francisco Chronicle," A joyous, hilarious send-up of rock star pretensions and an enchanting celebration of ""girl power"" in pop culture. "
331,Spice World,3.6,75,San Francisco Examiner," Without much of a plot to speak of and relying almost entirely on the girls' star power and charisma - which they have in spades - turns out to be a truly entertaining movie for anyone with even a bare knowledge of the Spice Girls' history, which in this age of absolute over-saturation, is hard to avoid. "
332,Spice World,3.6,70,The New York Times," Disarmingly, the film thus acknowledges the Spice Girls' flash-in-the-pan status and lets them kid around about their frankly synthetic career. "
333,Spice World,3.6,50,ReelViews," Although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles' classic, it's several long strides behind, lacking the same sense of originality, spontaneity, high energy, and joi de vivre. "
334,Spice World,3.6,50,Entertainment Weekly," Shabbily filmed, thoroughly harmless Official Product. "
335,Spice World,3.6,50,Salon," There are several non sequitur subplots woven together -- and that, along with a dearth of acting talent, is Spice World's biggest flaw. "
336,Spice World,3.6,30,Austin Chronicle," Bad as it may be, though, the film falls that one precious inch shy of being quite so awful that it achieves cult status; in short, it's just not bad enough to be any good. "
337,Spice World,3.6,20,Chicago Reader," A promotional tool that establishes its superfluousness simply by existing, this clumsy, smirking movie has a bitter soul. "
338,Spice World,3.6,12,Chicago Sun-Times, They're so detached they can't even successfully lip-synch their own songs. 
339,Spice World,3.6,10,Dallas Observer, Rarely has one movie seemed so predestined to reduce any and all attempted criticism to so many column inches of impotent gibberish. 
340,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,60,Film Threat," Sure, Dumb and Dumberer is dumb, dumber and dumberer than the original, but if you like that kind of banal, rustic and sophomoric humor (and I have to admit, I kinda do), it might be worth a buck or two at a discount theater. "
341,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,38,New York Daily News," The movie's really about the impressions of the original performances by newcomers Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Olsen does an uncanny Carrey, and Richardson vaguely resembles Daniels. "
342,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,30,Los Angeles Times, Falls wildly short of its inspirations. 
343,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Long, lumbering and endlessly unfunny. "
344,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,25,USA Today," In ""There's Something About Mary,"" the gross gags were hilarious. Here, they're just vile. "
345,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,25,Portland Oregonian," Has all the gross-out humor but none of the goofy sweetness. It also has neither of the Farrellys, which is agonizingly evident throughout. "
346,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,20,L.A. Weekly," Levy, Luis Guzman, Cheri Oteri -- utterly wasted. At 82 minutes it feels longer than “Lawrence of Arabia” -- and a lot less funny. "
347,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,20,Chicago Reader," The best thing I can say about this limp prequel to the Farrelly brothers' Dumb & Dumber is that it obliged me to check out the original, which I'd been studiously avoiding for years. If you haven't seen it, it's pretty funny, and mercifully light on the scatology and cheap sentiment of later Farrelly efforts. "
348,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,10,Washington Post," To call it sophomoric would libel even the most pathetic, pimply underclassman. "
349,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.6,0,Austin Chronicle," Even with its scant running time, this nightmarish travesty barrels along with all the whipcord speed and nimble comedic grace of a loved one’s funeral. "
350,The Master of Disguise,3.6,25,Philadelphia Inquirer, Totally lame. 
351,The Master of Disguise,3.6,25,Baltimore Sun," Hands-down, the best James Brolin-in-an-Italian-accent movie ever. "
352,The Master of Disguise,3.6,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line after barely 65 minutes of movie, and then follows it with 15 minutes of end credits in an attempt to clock in as a feature film. "
353,The Master of Disguise,3.6,25,USA Today," Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie. "
354,The Master of Disguise,3.6,20,Chicago Reader," Imagine combining bad imitations of the ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Austin Powers"" movies and you'll have a rough idea of this feeble Dana Carvey farce. "
355,The Master of Disguise,3.6,20,Variety," Vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy, colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10. "
356,The Master of Disguise,3.6,20,TV Guide Magazine, Painfully unfunny and misguided to boot. 
357,The Master of Disguise,3.6,20,New Times (L.A.)," Mostly this happy train wreck feels like a longer, better movie that was chopped up and reassembled by retarded monkeys; what should have been a rush instead feels rushed. "
358,The Master of Disguise,3.6,16,Entertainment Weekly," An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill ''Saturday Night Live'' skits. "
359,The Master of Disguise,3.6,0,New York Post," No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise, an unbearably tedious and unfunny comedy. "
360,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.6,40,TV Guide Magazine," Since all these revisited series have run out of steam, this sorry sequel is only recommended for aging nostalgists. "
361,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.6,20,Empire," Energetically humourless, with travelogue and circus footage inserted between the dog-piss and big boob jokes. "
362,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.6,10,Variety," An inept, geriatric romp that's for completists only. "
363,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.6,0,Time Out," Lame, sloppy, cack-handed, utterly redundant - put succinctly, the very worst of the series. "
364,Crossroads,3.6,50,New Times (L.A.)," Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply, but those who loved ""Cool as Ice"" have at last found a worthy follow-up. "
365,Crossroads,3.6,40,Slate, So vanilla yet so transcendentally sleazy that its target audience seems to be pubescent girls and dirty old priests. 
366,Crossroads,3.6,40,Film Threat," Spears, Davis, and company are well aware that they're making nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of Spears' glossy bubble gum pop -- but that's exactly the problem. "
367,Crossroads,3.6,40,Salon," The movie is a lumbering load of hokum, but unlike those other recent pop star white elephants -- it's at least watchable. "
368,Crossroads,3.6,38,USA Today, Less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip. 
369,Crossroads,3.6,30,The New Yorker," What it's really about, of course, is the very delicate marketing problem of turning a super-bland pop star into an acceptable human being onscreen. [4 Mar 2002, p. 90] "
370,Crossroads,3.6,20,The A.V. Club," Spears is filmed and costumed in such a harsh, unflattering manner that it looks like Christina Aguilera bribed the crew to make her rival look as hideous as possible. Spears' ubiquity has spawned an inevitable backlash, but the awful Crossroads ought to do more harm to her career than even the most powerful Britney-basher. "
371,Crossroads,3.6,20,Variety, Awfully lame bigscreen debut for pop diva Britney Spears. 
372,Crossroads,3.6,0,Baltimore Sun," Go see Crossroads if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs. "
373,Crossroads,3.6,0,Washington Post, It does wonders to a critic to know that [Britney] could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come. 
374,Scary Movie 5,3.6,30,The Hollywood Reporter, This latest installment of the horror movie spoof franchise is mainly notable for its Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Lohan cameos. 
375,Scary Movie 5,3.6,30,The New York Times," Marlon Wayans’s satire “A Haunted House” got to “Paranormal” first, and for a much smaller budget delivered bigger laughs. "
376,Scary Movie 5,3.6,25,McClatchy-Tribune News Service, Scary Movie 5 comes up short in every way imaginable. 
377,Scary Movie 5,3.6,25,The A.V. Club," Scary Movie 5 aspires to timeliness, but its comic sensibility is so groaningly retro that the film features a series of tributes to The Benny Hill Show and its signature ditty, “Yakety Sax.” "
378,Scary Movie 5,3.6,25,Entertainment Weekly," Somehow, it actually looks cheaper than ""Paranormal Activity."" It's less funny, too. "
379,Scary Movie 5,3.6,25,New York Post, This is a horror movie that’s really a supposed comedy; she’s (Lohan) a supposed comedy actress who’s actually scary. 
380,Scary Movie 5,3.6,20,New York Daily News," Luckily, folks like Snoop and good sports like Sheen and, yes, Lohan, break up the monotony. Until, like an undead beastie, the boredom and dumb jokes come roaring back. "
381,Scary Movie 5,3.6,20,Empire," Lacking a single honest laugh, this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels… which throws it in a pit with Transylmania, Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing. "
382,Scary Movie 5,3.6,10,Variety," Audiences not inclined to laugh at the sight of a baby’s head catching fire are encouraged to at least chuckle at the various gags made at the expense of Jody and Dan’s housekeeper (a game Lidia Porto), who satisfies many of the picture’s comedic-target prerequisites by being plus-sized, hysterically religious and Latina. "
383,Scary Movie 5,3.6,5,Film.com," Scary Movie 5 is so massively un-enjoyable, a hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator. "
384,Feardotcom,3.6,50,Chicago Sun-Times," Strange, how good feardotcom is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see. "
385,Feardotcom,3.6,40,New Times (L.A.)," If sudden loud noises, relentless strobe lights, digital hallucinations and mutilated corpses make you jump, and you feel that nothing more is required for a good time at the movies, welcome to Feardotcom. "
386,Feardotcom,3.6,40,Variety," Never quite realizes its potential to evoke the real horror of the Internet -- Yet, Malone has given the film a distinctive atmosphere and occasional flashes of his perverse sense of humor. "
387,Feardotcom,3.6,30,TV Guide Magazine," There's a germ of an interesting idea here, but it's smothered by gloomy cinematography a la ""Seven"" (1995) and grating implausibilities, like the fact that everyone lives in the kind of cavernous, dankly art-directed dumps that only internet millionaires and trust fund twinkies can afford in the real New York. "
388,Feardotcom,3.6,25,New York Post," A low-rent, slow-witted horror flick notable chiefly for its hilariously unsuccessful attempt to pass off Luxembourg City as New York City. "
389,Feardotcom,3.6,25,New York Daily News," The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly. "
390,Feardotcom,3.6,20,The A.V. Club," Made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises, but it's quickly apparent that there's no thought or originality under its grim, familiar surface. "
391,Feardotcom,3.6,10,Film Threat," This movie is plain stupid from the get go, but at least it looks good. "
392,Feardotcom,3.6,10,Los Angeles Times," The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene, and it makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if they're trying to remain unrecognized. "
393,Feardotcom,3.6,10,L.A. Weekly," The film, whose clumsy editing and dearth of establishing shots keep the viewer in an unintended state of confusion, is a corpse in its own right: It’s filled with the rotting ideas of far better movies. "
394,The Room,3.7,30,Chicago Reader," This inept 2003 melodrama has become a Rocky Horror-style cult favorite...As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality. "
395,The Room,3.7,25,Portland Oregonian," Tommy Wiseau's film oozes sincerity, which is then slathered in a thick coating of oblivious narcissism, and sadly serves as an example that not everyone should follow their bliss...It's the emotional earnestness that places The Room squarely within Susan Sontag's famous definition of pure camp. "
396,The Room,3.7,12,Chicago Sun-Times," You can laugh at lines like: ""Hey, everybody, let's go inside and eat some cake""; ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!""; ""Man, I just can't figure women out. Sometimes they're just too smart. Sometimes they're flat out stupid. Other times they're just evil."" In Wiseau's worldview, if ""The Room"" were a woman, she wouldn't be ""evil"" or ""too smart."" That leaves ""flat-out stupid."" [12 Feb 2012, p.B2] "
397,The Room,3.7,10,Variety," The Room marks the writing-directing-acting debut of Tommy Wiseau, who's not just one of the most unusual looking and sounding (with an unidentifiable Eastern European accent) leading men ever to grace the screen, but a narcissist nonpareil whose movie makes Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" seem the apotheosis of cinematic self-restraint. "
398,The Room,3.7,0,Movie Nation," That’s the trick to making a cult film. It can’t just be bad, it has to be memorably so, and The Room is. "
399,Teen Wolf Too,3.7,25,Chicago Tribune," Given the grosses of the original, a sequel to Teen Wolf was inevitable-and it was inevitable, too, that the sequel would lose the quality of innocence and unconscious artfulness that made the first film work. The material has been broken down, analyzed and reassembled with scientific precision; what was instinctive in the original has become self-conscious and calculated in the followup, and the spirit is gone. "
400,Teen Wolf Too,3.7,20,The New York Times," No one expects realism from a movie called Teen Wolf Too... still, the film makers could pretend to know what college is like, might try to liven up the kindly werewolf formula. "
401,Teen Wolf Too,3.7,12,Washington Post, Teen Wolf Too is nothing a jar of Nair wouldn't cure. 
402,Teen Wolf Too,3.7,10,Los Angeles Times," Teen Wolf Too embellishes its inane, cookie-cutter plot with remote direction, witless dialogue and charmless characters. "
403,Teen Wolf Too,3.7,0,Miami Herald," Teen Wolf Too is a relentlessly idiotic sequel to 1985's Teen Wolf. [1 Dec 1987, p.B5] "
404,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,70,L.A. Weekly, Slight but immensely enjoyable charmer. 
405,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,60,Dallas Observer, Robert Rodriguez and his kids conjure up a charming 3-D fantasy. 
406,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,50,The Hollywood Reporter, An often imaginative though less than magical family feature. 
407,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,50,Variety," There's little chance of grabbing teens (or even many tweens) during summertime playdates. Still, small fry will be enchanted by this rambunctious action-adventure. "
408,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,42,Entertainment Weekly," Like choral singing and travel photography, this adventure is more fun for participants than it is for spectators. "
409,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,38,Chicago Tribune, There's really just not a lot here. I'm sure Racer's story will entertain the very wee ones -- but so do keys. 
410,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,38,Charlotte Observer, The story's so sloppy that it contradicts itself constantly. 
411,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,30,Time," Pretty lame. Sharkboy has an especially frantic, amateur atmosphere, with a mostly maladroit cast. "
412,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,30,Village Voice," Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside ""100%"" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA. "
413,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.7,30,The A.V. Club," Sadly, the film's creaky, sometimes painful dialogue makes it all too easy to believe that it was genuinely co-written by a small child. "
414,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,30,Movieline," That Bucky Larson's humor is stuck at a toilet-centric grade school level is less damning than how little of that or any humor it contains - the film, directed by Tom Brady (The Hot Chick), sets up scene after scene that wanders around in the general vicinity of a joke idea without ever approaching anything like a punchline. "
415,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,25,Entertainment Weekly, Bucky Larson is a one-note joke played over and over and over. 
416,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,25,Orlando Sentinel," It's an ugly movie to look at and a faintly nauseating one to sit through, truth be told. "
417,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,25,Boston Globe," Never thought we'd say this about a movie, but Bucky Larson probably doesn't wring as much out of recurring bodily-fluid gags as it could. "
418,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,20,Los Angeles Times," The scenario makes for an inept, lazy R-rated movie whose sole purpose is as a glossary of euphemisms for genitalia and sexual acts. "
419,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,16,The A.V. Club," Apparently no one told Ricci she was acting in a comedy, not a touching drama about a young woman overcoming a formative trauma to achieve her dreams. "
420,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,10,The Hollywood Reporter," Unfortunately, the R rating will prohibit the target audience -- namely teenage boys who find penis jokes endlessly hilarious - from seeing this relentlessly unfunny and vulgar effort until it shows up on video and cable. "
421,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,10,The New York Times, This may be the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever been in. Think about that. 
422,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,10,New York Daily News," This god-awful, unfunny, stinkingly putrid sketch-comic movie has exactly one snicker-worthy moment, involving Kevin Nealon and a stolen grape. But watching the rest of it will make you whine. "
423,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.7,10,Variety, One of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year. 
424,Batman & Robin,3.7,70,The New York Times," Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible. "
425,Batman & Robin,3.7,60,Salon," There's something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing, capable acting or inspired directing. "
426,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,Chicago Sun-Times," Batman & Robin, like the first three films in the series, is wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core. "
427,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,ReelViews," This film, which places yet another actor in the batsuit, has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue. "
428,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,San Francisco Chronicle," It's the lightest of the Batman movies, the most cartoony, the dumbest and the least ambitious. But it holds the audience's attention, brings on a few laughs and never really gets boring. "
429,Batman & Robin,3.7,40,L.A. Weekly," There's so much happening in the movie that it feels like nothing is happening at all. Which leaves you free to gaze, slack-jawed, on the true glory of Batman & Robin -- its fabulously color-coded set design. "
430,Batman & Robin,3.7,25,San Francisco Examiner, Clooney's stiff cornball delivery and tendency to smile during the most tragic moments bring this as close to the cartoonish Batman television series of the 1960s as any of the movies have come. 
431,Batman & Robin,3.7,20,Austin Chronicle," Batman & Robin fails to engage the spirit of Batman, Robin, or decent marketing in general, and instead ends up as a limp, excruciatingly shallow knockoff that leaves viewers cringing at the unavoidable one-liners that make up the better part of the script. "
432,Batman & Robin,3.7,10,The A.V. Club," Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman, but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics, he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse, backwards. "
433,Batman & Robin,3.7,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward. "
434,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,67,Austin Chronicle," Far more coherent than its immediate predecessor, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D benefits greatly from its two likable young leads and some of the series' wittiest, pun-filled writing. "
435,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,60,Boxoffice Magazine," Far more charming, quick-witted and high spirited than anyone could have expected...for a film that didn't screen for press. It's gimmicky up the wazoo (not just 3D, but scratch-and-sniff ""Aroma-Scope"" cards handed out at screenings) and it's all the better for it. "
436,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,50,Movieline," The film is being released in both 2- and 3-D, and from what I could tell the 3-D version is still almost 50-50. What use is made of the technology is hardly worth the effort, unless you've always wanted to experience a cascade of cheesies in 3-D. "
437,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,50,Chicago Reader," The visual effects are as gleefully shoddy as ever, and the playful ideas sometimes achieve a dreamlike suggestiveness. "
438,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,38,Orlando Sentinel, Nobody has much that's funny to say or cool to do. Even the spy gadgets are lame. 
439,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,38,Boston Globe," Alba, meanwhile, is again ridiculously shoehorned into a comedy gig, although she does have an amusing opening bit spying while nine months pregnant. If only diaper bomb gags weren't the inevitable follow-up. "
440,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,33,The A.V. Club," The Spy Kids series once seemed charmingly homemade. These days, it feels less charmingly homemade than maddeningly amateurish. "
441,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Arriving eight years after the lame third installment in Dimension's profitable series, this seems like far too little way too late. "
442,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,30,Variety," A cheap-looking, vaguely depressing echo of Robert Rodriguez's well-loved kidpic trilogy, assembled with minimal imagination or effort. "
443,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.7,30,The New York Times," The fall-off in sexiness, soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas, the parents in the first three ""Spy Kids"" films, to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep. "
444,Jaws 3-D,3.7,50,The New York Times," It's harmless but unsurprising...Without Steven Spielberg's timing or John Williams's music, the shark's periodic visits become feeding scenes rather than ferocious attacks. It's like watching someone make regular raids on a refrigerator in search of midnight snacks. "
445,Jaws 3-D,3.7,50,Miami Herald," Yes, it's all pretty silly. But for those who can stand the annoyance of the cardboard glasses, there are worse ways to kill a hot afternoon. [23 July 1983, p.D6] "
446,Jaws 3-D,3.7,40,TV Guide Magazine," Although shot well and boasting some effective 3-D work, this is a woefully inadequate effort, and the series began to slip into inadvertent self-parody. "
447,Jaws 3-D,3.7,30,Variety, The Jaws cycle has reached its nadir with this surprisingly tepid [Arrivision] 3-D version. 
448,Jaws 3-D,3.7,30,Washington Post," Jaws 3-D makes a conclusive case for terminating further sequels to ""Jaws,"" as if one were needed. It also reinforces the impression that 3-D is unlikely to make a sustained comeback until its optical inconveniences and dependence on hokey scare effects can be overcome. [23 July 1983, p.C1] "
449,Jaws 3-D,3.7,30,Newsweek," One can safely doze through the extremely bland first hour, which feels more like an advertisement for marine theme parks than a suspense movie. [1 Aug 1983, p.47] "
450,Jaws 3-D,3.7,20,Empire," A toothless, tedious farce which deserves to sink without a trace. "
451,Jaws 3-D,3.7,20,Time Out London, A right royal turkey. 
452,Jaws 3-D,3.7,20,Washington Post," Jaws 3-D, in which the Amity horror swims south to Florida, looks a lot like a Poligrip commercial, what with its extreme close-ups of the Great White's artificial chompers. [29 July 1983, p.17] "
453,The Wicker Man,3.8,75,New York Post," Profoundly disturbing, blood-chilling suspenser. "
454,The Wicker Man,3.8,50,Los Angeles Times," In the end, LaBute's remake is an interesting idea that never transforms into a particularly satisfying movie. "
455,The Wicker Man,3.8,40,Film Threat, The Wicker Man isn't all that bad a movie; it's visually striking and ambitious in some ways. It just fails to bring enough to the table to fully distance itself from the original. 
456,The Wicker Man,3.8,40,L.A. Weekly," This wasn't a horror film the first time around, and LaBute makes sorry feints at effective creepiness, letting the story roam in circles just like Cage. "
457,The Wicker Man,3.8,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Unlikely to inspire a passionate following similar to the original, the film, which opened Friday without being screened for the press, ultimately induces more titters than dread. "
458,The Wicker Man,3.8,40,Variety, Any provocative questions LaBute might have wanted to raise are totally obscured as the rising tide of absurdity gradually overwhelms the entire enterprise. 
459,The Wicker Man,3.8,38,TV Guide Magazine," There may be a way to remake 1973's cult thriller The Wicker Man, in which a deeply Christian cop has his religious convictions shaken to the core as he investigates the disappearance of a child from within a cheerfully pagan community, but Neil LaBute didn't find it. "
460,The Wicker Man,3.8,38,New York Daily News," As an allegory of religious conflict, the '73 film is brilliantly constructed and ends with a punctuation mark that was shocking in its day. LaBute's movie attempts to shock, as well, and does: Given the names involved and the casting of Cage, it is shockingly bad. "
461,The Wicker Man,3.8,33,The A.V. Club, Turns a cultishly creepy classic into a dull and windy farce. 
462,The Wicker Man,3.8,30,The New York Times," A movie like this can survive an absurd premise but not incompetent execution. And Mr. LaBute, never much of an artist with the camera, proves almost comically inept as a horror-movie technician...It's neither haunting nor amusing; just boring. "
463,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,60,Los Angeles Times," ""Black” foregoes too much scene-setting, chronology and logic to stand completely on its own. As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in “Grey” and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original’s numerous plot holes. "
464,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,58,Entertainment Weekly, The film manages to be surprisingly subversive with its humor. 
465,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,42,The A.V. Club, When Wayans allows himself to deviate from his formula there are a few effective moments of un-self-conscious slapstick. 
466,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,40,The New York Times," As with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull’s-eyes arrive only intermittently. "
467,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,38,Slant Magazine," An aimless, if sporadically clever, parody that tirelessly conceives of human sexuality as punchlines for its shortsighted cultural ribbings. "
468,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,38,RogerEbert.com," Mostly, Fifty Shades of Black is exactly what you expect it will be. It hits all the notes of its source material, only it amps them up, and it seems to get the inherent absurdity of this premise even more than Sam Taylor-Johnson’s movie did. "
469,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,33,Consequence of Sound," Marlon Wayans is clearly getting off on the gags, but the lazy, hard humor, and elastic joke-making eventually has a numbing effect. "
470,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,30,Variety," At a minimum, a parody should be funnier than the film it’s sending up, but Fifty Shades of Black, a quick-and-dirty riff on last year’s S&M romance “Fifty Shades of Grey,” falls a laugh or two short of even that low standard. "
471,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,20,The Hollywood Reporter," The funniest bit involves a particularly sadistic brand of torture that he inflicts on Hannah.... She quite rightly screams in protest, as should anyone forced to watch this movie. "
472,Fifty Shades of Black,3.8,0,TheWrap, A slapdash movie that’s more unbearable than the heavy-breathing best-seller and its emotionally timid screen adaptation. 
473,D-War,3.8,63,TV Guide Magazine," Frankly, it's dumb, but no dumber than ""Transformers."" "
474,D-War,3.8,50,Variety," A feast of A-grade f/x married to a Z-grade, irony-free script. "
475,D-War,3.8,50,The New York Times," It is such a breathless, delirious stew, it’s impossible not to be entertained, provided -- this is crucial -- you have a sense of humor. "
476,D-War,3.8,40,The Hollywood Reporter," While the CGI effects are undeniably impressive, the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor (most of it involving a hapless zoo security guard) seriously detract from the fun. "
477,D-War,3.8,38,Boston Globe," You don't have to hand the folks behind Dragon Wars much (the acting, directing, costumes, editing, props, music, etc: They're all off). But when they decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown Los Angeles, the movie turns shockingly watchable. "
478,D-War,3.8,30,L.A. Weekly, This one’s for connoisseurs of the “totally preposterous crap” school of fantasy cinema. 
479,D-War,3.8,30,Los Angeles Times, Fluent in the laughable dialogue of a million bad fantasy flicks: 
480,D-War,3.8,30,Austin Chronicle, This South Korean pseudo-epic is some of the most ambitious cr-- I've ever seen. 
481,D-War,3.8,16,The A.V. Club," All the thought seems to have gone into the marketing, and none into the unfathomably terrible script. "
482,The Fog,3.8,50,Boston Globe," This new Fog floats in on the fumes of the 1980 John Carpenter original, but the surprise is that it's arguably better. "
483,The Fog,3.8,50,The A.V. Club," It's virtually indiscernible from any other contemporary horror film except for, well, the fog. "
484,The Fog,3.8,40,The New York Times," Mildly scary here and there. It does not play by all the horror movie rules (e.g., the black guy always dies first). And the cast is good-looking. "
485,The Fog,3.8,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Director Rupert Wainwright fails to bring any style to the material, not producing a fraction of the suspense or wit generated by Carpenter in the original even while working with a far lesser budget. "
486,The Fog,3.8,40,Variety," Unfortunately, interest lags between the grisly deaths, and, worse, none of the characters generates rooting interest. "
487,The Fog,3.8,38,TV Guide Magazine," If the characters were more interesting, the long, long buildup to their night of ghostly reckoning might be suspenseful rather than tedious. "
488,The Fog,3.8,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Most of The Fog will seem drearily perfunctory even to those viewers who don't know Carpenter's version, which itself emulated the elegant gloom of Val Lewton's horror pics of the 1940s. "
489,The Fog,3.8,25,New York Daily News," The fog also does something genuinely eerie: It causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned, burned, stabbed or thrown into glass display cases. "
490,The Fog,3.8,25,New York Post," I was held in suspense throughout The Fog, aching to learn the answer to its central riddle: Why would any one remake such a crummy movie? "
491,The Fog,3.8,10,Film Threat," It's too mediocre (and PG-13) to be classified as a horror film, too inane to be taken seriously and too uninteresting to be bothered with. "
492,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,60,The New York Times," Threadbare as it's beginning to look, the Superman series hasn't lost its raison d'etre. There's life in the old boy yet. "
493,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,60,Tampa Bay Times," Superman IV: The Quest for Peace doesn't attempt to disguise its sentiments - no more so than Greenpeace - but neither does it lose the campy spirit of the 1978 original. Although never as stylish as the first movie, it shows verve and a modest wit. Superman IV is not as funny as the first sequel, but it isn't as violent, either. [27 July 1987, p.1D] "
494,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,38,Miami Herald," Superman IV works rather well as a children's movie. It even has a line or two for adults -- though not, one hastens to qualify, enough to actually warrant adult attendance. [25 July 1987, p.B1] "
495,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,25,Chicago Tribune," Superman IV is a pathetic appendage to the series, a dull, shoddy film that makes the minimal 1950s TV series seem rife with production values by comparison. [27 July 1987, p.10C] "
496,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,20,Variety," The earlier films in the series were far from perfect, but at their best they had some flair and agreeable humor, qualities this one sorely lacks. Hackman gets a few laughs, but has less to work with than before, and everyone else seems to be just going through the motions and having less fun doing so. "
497,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,20,Empire, Predictably awful fourth installment. 
498,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,20,Chicago Reader," By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour. "
499,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,20,Washington Post," Superman IV, except for a glitzy new villain named Nuclear Man, is one of the cheesiest movies ever made. It's so grainy and grossly envisioned, it seems filmed on pulp. Superman's crystalline Arctic palace looks as if it's made of no-deposit-no-return soda bottles, and his suit of primary colors has ring around the collar. "
500,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,12,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," This one is a big, big disappointment. [27 July 1987] "
501,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.8,10,Los Angeles Times," Sequels to big-budget popular hits usually end up super-slick, shallow and inflated. But this one isn't even super-slick; it's shallow and deflated...The overall effect is of a story atomized and dying before our eyes, collapsing into smashed pulp, ground down into big-budget Kryptonite ash. [27 July 1987, p.1] "
502,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,60,Chicago Reader," But the most stimulating, satisfying aspect of this action fantasy is the theme music. "
503,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved. "
504,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,20,Empire, It would miss the point to complain that the plot is nonsensical drivel peopled by paper-thin characters and a paucity of ideas. 
505,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,20,TV Guide Magazine," This tedious hodgepodge of martial-arts mayhem, bogus mysticism and computer-generated special effects doesn't even pretend to have a plot. "
506,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,16,Entertainment Weekly," Fragmented and monotonous, without a semblance of the gymnastic cleverness that at least made the first Mortal Kombat film into watchable trash, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is as debased as movies come. "
507,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,12,ReelViews," This film has no story, no characters, and no coherence. "
508,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,10,The New York Times, Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull. 
509,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,10,Los Angeles Times," The sequel is quite serious, charmless and critic-proof (in fact, it wasn't screened for the media), and it may attract the teenagers who have made the game so popular. [24Nov1997 Pg.10] "
510,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,0,Austin Chronicle, The movie is nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed (by returning star Robin Shou) fight sequences that mix live-action foregrounds with complexly layered digital effects and are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements. 
511,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.8,0,L.A. Weekly," It's cynical and it's depressing, and I would lock a child in a room before I'd show him Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. "
512,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,60,L.A. Weekly," In short, it’s a gift-wrapped part for Lohan, who plays her good-girl/bad-girl role with wit and an air of sly calculation. "
513,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,50,Boston Globe, An intensely unpleasant killer-thriller mystery. 
514,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,38,TV Guide Magazine," The most shocking thing about this ludicrous serial-killer shocker, released the week troubled 21-year-old former child star Lindsay Lohan was arrested on DUI and cocaine-possession charges, is that it's the kind of film actresses generally make when their careers are well and truly on the skids. "
515,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,38,Chicago Tribune," The film suggests Lohan probably (allegedly) should've gone after her agent the other night, not the mother of an ex-personal assistant. "
516,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,30,Variety," Much like the ongoing real-world meltdown of its troubled star, Lindsay Lohan, I Know Who Killed Me is a disaster that exerts a perverse fascination. "
517,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,25,ReelViews," Unless you derive pleasure from watching Lohan being tortured, there's no reason to subject yourself to this movie. Besides, if that's your goal, all you have to do is turn on tabloid TV. There's Lindsay's living hell of a life, being broadcast 24/7. "
518,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,16,The A.V. Club," Having broken free of the Disney machine that molded her, Lohan now seems intent on destroying her career and credibility on her own terms. "
519,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,0,The Hollywood Reporter, There's a fresh candidate in the running for worst movie of 2007 honors. 
520,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,0,New York Post," Sony dumped this sleazy, inept and worthless piece of torture porn into theaters yesterday. "
521,I Know Who Killed Me,3.8,0,Premiere," I can’t say I was too surprised by how risible, grotesque, and incoherent I Know Who Killed Me is. But I can’t say I was prepared for its pretentiousness. If the picture has any use at all, it’s as a case study in what happens when the talentless attempt to emulate the inspired. "
522,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,50,New York Daily News," The special effects work fine for minor acts of magic, but the climactic aerial dragon fight is lame, and most of the performances are at the level of high school plays. "
523,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," Much of the dialogue is the silliest sort of fantasy mush, and a good deal of the picture appears to have been shot while the lighting guys were out to lunch. "
524,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,50,Boston Globe, A mildly entertaining but tepid extravaganza more suited to television than the big screen. 
525,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,25,San Francisco Chronicle," The audience has already checked out, long before the formulaic finish. "
526,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,20,Film.com," Good intentions, bad writing. "
527,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,10,L.A. Weekly," A cheap ""Star Wars"" rip-off with swords instead of light sabers. "
528,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,10,Salon," This fantasy crap, fake-o effects and all, betrays princes of dice, masters of graph and wielders of bong. "
529,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,10,The New York Times, Take this as a warning: it's not much fun. 
530,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,0,Village Voice, At once laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible. 
531,Dungeons & Dragons,3.8,0,New York Post," Tacky-looking, incoherent, badly acted and hopelessly directed disaster is easily the dullest adventure film of 2000. "
532,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,50,The New York Times, What results is a candy-colored broad comedy with noteworthy performances. 
533,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,50,Portland Oregonian," Cute and funny, with plenty of slapstick and cuddly creatures for the kids and enough adult wit to keep parents reasonably amused. "
534,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,50,Los Angeles Times," It feels more like a cartoon, and when you're dealing with modern Stone Age families, that can only be a plus. "
535,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,30,Film.com," This movie is a business decision, and about as diverting to watch as someone reading the Universal fiscal report. "
536,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,30,Washington Post," It's zany. Actually, it's so zany it's almost creepy. "
537,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,25,Baltimore Sun," A tired piece of hackery, made only slightly less distasteful by a couple of inspired moments from supporting player Alan Cumming. "
538,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,20,TNT RoughCut," A bumpy synthesis of special and visual effects done far too over the top ultimately means Viva Rock Vegas is nothing more than eye candy, and not a very tasty piece at that. "
539,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,20,Film.com, A Dum-Dum Movie 
540,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,20,L.A. Weekly, Everything from the Rube Goldberg sets to the Jim Henson creatures is aimed squarely at a preschool audience. 
541,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.9,0,Austin Chronicle, Even the youngest members of the audience appeared to be more interested in their dwindling soda supply than anything up on the screen. Yabba dabba doom. 
542,The Avengers,3.9,40,Newsweek," This is an elaborate production, but all the jazzy sets and explosions in the world can't disguise the story's complete lack of urgency. "
543,The Avengers,3.9,30,Austin Chronicle," This new film version, sad to say, is a hollow shell of the original series. "
544,The Avengers,3.9,25,ReelViews, This film is an absolute mess. 
545,The Avengers,3.9,20,Los Angeles Times, So how then do you duplicate a magic aura from 30 years ago? You don't. 
546,The Avengers,3.9,20,Chicago Reader," The grasping novelty of the visuals doesn't rival the uncharismatic leads or the hopelessly, unironically banal plot. "
547,The Avengers,3.9,10,L.A. Weekly, It's shockingly inert. 
548,The Avengers,3.9,10,Salon," The film flails incoherently from set to set, trying to be kicky and madcap and pop, but with no sense of the show's casual acceptance of the absurd. "
549,The Avengers,3.9,10,The New York Times, It's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. 
550,The Avengers,3.9,0,The A.V. Club, It's almost fascinating to witness just how lousy The Avengers really is. 
551,The Avengers,3.9,0,San Francisco Chronicle," It's a completely botched effort -- botched in its direction, its writing and editing. "
552,Piranha 3DD,3.9,60,Variety," Ups the self-parody so much that it's practically a Wayans Brothers spoof, albeit with fewer jokes. "
553,Piranha 3DD,3.9,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Piranha 3DD is overcrowded and pointlessly mean. The stunt casting of David Hasselhoff playing himself, riffing off his infamous 2007 drunken home video, gets in the way of the storyline. "
554,Piranha 3DD,3.9,40,Total Film," ""Welcome to rock bottom!"" sighs Hasselhoff at one stage, pretty much summing up this textbook exercise in sloppy seconds. Here's hoping the piranhas have a better agent than he does. "
555,Piranha 3DD,3.9,40,Boxoffice Magazine," It seems impossible that a sequel to a movie as ridiculous as ""Piranha 3D"" could disappoint but Piranha 3DD stops at mediocre before arriving at gloriously bad. "
556,Piranha 3DD,3.9,30,Village Voice," Add to this that it takes place in the town of Merkin, and you'll get an idea of the labored spirit of dirty-old-man humor that prevails. "
557,Piranha 3DD,3.9,25,Slant Magazine," John Gulager is neither artist nor genius, bringing only straight-to-video conviction to Piranha 3DD. "
558,Piranha 3DD,3.9,25,Movieline," ""Piranha 3D"" was ridiculous, gory and fun, everything Piranha 3DD is not. "
559,Piranha 3DD,3.9,20,Time Out, Hecklers can take the night off; ripping on a movie this bad is as rewarding as shooting fish in a barrel. 
560,Piranha 3DD,3.9,20,The New York Times," The director, John Gulager, has no idea how to mix his ingredients to create a savvy self-parody. "
561,Piranha 3DD,3.9,11,Austin Chronicle," Disappointingly, Piranha 3DD, the inevitable sequel to the remake, has none of Dante's wit, Aja's directorial skills, or Greg Nicotero's grotesqueries. "
562,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,88,Chicago Sun-Times, Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure. 
563,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,50,The New York Times," Despite huge resources at Mr. De Bont's disposal and the fact that both he and Ms. Bullock have achieved stellar status since ''Speed'' screeched onto movie screens, the sequel is still a B-movie at heart. "
564,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,40,Austin Chronicle," Not nearly as clever at taxing the audience's knuckles as its forerunner, Speed 2 still manages to stay above board long enough to merit a look-see, if only to relish the once-in-a-lifetime pleasure of Mr. Dafoe and his pet leeches. "
565,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,38,ReelViews, Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made. 
566,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,25,San Francisco Examiner, This is my idea of a nightmare. 
567,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," And De Bont's effects are wildly over the top, devoid of the stylish cuts and intriguing angles that enriched the original. In fact, there's so little panache in his destructive action that it begins to seem like a weird act of self-destruction. "
568,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,10,Washington Post," The 1994 ""Speed,"" which starred Bullock and Keanu Reeves, was hardly ""King Lear"" on a bus, but it was an entertaining ride. But this movie is nothing but pain to sit through. "
569,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,0,Salon, Speed 2 is such an inept piece of direction that it's anybody's guess whether De Bont understands how to convey where two characters are in spatial relation to each other or in relation to the action. 
570,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,0,San Francisco Chronicle," This may be hard to believe, but there's not a single moment of drama or tension in any of the action sequences. And the film is made up almost entirely of action. "
571,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.9,0,Washington Post," The kinetics aren't that good, the twaddle is off the charts and the characters seem written by monkeys on amphetamines with crayons. "
572,You Got Served,3.9,60,Dallas Observer," Director Christopher B. Stokes (House Party 4) shapes up the fabulous dance sequences with undeniable energy, and real-life brothers Houston and Grandberry are two of the most enjoyable musicians to appear onscreen since Sting played a bellboy. "
573,You Got Served,3.9,50,Boston Globe," Part soap opera and part thriller, and it has the unique characteristic of being both undeveloped and overwritten. "
574,You Got Served,3.9,40,L.A. Weekly," Seems stuck in fad mode, a showcase in search of a movie. "
575,You Got Served,3.9,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Assembling this vehicle for his young clients, music producer/manager/video director Christopher B. Stokes has attached an anemic plot to a series of dynamic hip-hop dance sequences. "
576,You Got Served,3.9,40,Variety," A serviceable youth pic that's marginally less dumb than November's urban quasi-musical ""Honey."" "
577,You Got Served,3.9,40,The New York Times," Will probably keep its core audience of suburban teenagers mildly entertained for the course of its 93 minutes. Urban grumps, however, may be distracted by Mr. Stokes's annoyingly overedited execution of the dance sequences. "
578,You Got Served,3.9,38,Baltimore Sun, The astonishing brio and verve of street dancing deserves better than this. 
579,You Got Served,3.9,25,New York Daily News, This amateurish drama about street-dance contests and busted friendship is about as real as Lil' Kim's chest. 
580,You Got Served,3.9,25,New York Post," Cliched, amateurish and feeble. "
581,You Got Served,3.9,25,Philadelphia Inquirer, Rarely do you encounter a movie without a shred of originality. You Got Served is such a cinematic vacuum. 
582,The Love Guru,3.9,42,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," If you're a Toronto native or a big-time hockey geek, there are enough little in jokes to probably carry you through the leaden pacing and barrel-scraping gross-out humor, but it's an awfully dull ride for the rest of us. "
583,The Love Guru,3.9,40,Variety," So relentlessly juvenile as to merit a new twist on the PG-13 rating -- one that strongly cautions not only those under 13 but anyone much above it, too. "
584,The Love Guru,3.9,38,Chicago Tribune," The Love Guru”does not bring out Myer's best, and aside from a deft early Bollywood parody, there’s nothing visually to help the fun along. "
585,The Love Guru,3.9,33,The A.V. Club," Myers combines his love of references, silly names, and mindless repetition by having his guru use ""Mariska Hargitay"" as a greeting/mantra. The first time it's employed, it's merely unfunny; by the 13th or 40th time, it's almost hypnotic in its awfulness. "
586,The Love Guru,3.9,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Not only does the film stumble badly from one skit to another, the skits themselves have too much dead air. "
587,The Love Guru,3.9,30,Village Voice," Now and again some pungent writing leaks through to poke fun at the excruciating banality of guru wisdom. But mostly it’s dreary dick jokes and elephant poop, slack directing by Marco Schnabel, and, of all fatal errors, Mike Myers, shooting for cuddly. "
588,The Love Guru,3.9,30,Washington Post," The results are a wheezy, tired attempt to milk more laughs out of the '60s, by doing exactly what ""Austin Powers"" did. "
589,The Love Guru,3.9,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Myers has made some funny movies, but this film could have been written on toilet walls by callow adolescents. "
590,The Love Guru,3.9,20,Austin Chronicle, It recycles gags from earlier and better Myers movies and hopes that the audience won't notice because they're too busy staring at Timberlake's bursting Speedo. 
591,The Love Guru,3.9,20,NPR," None of them -- not one, not for a moment -- is remotely funny. "
592,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,50,ReelViews," A second-rate regurgitation of ""The Lord of the Rings."" Everything about it, down to the set and costume design, apes Peter Jackson's epic trilogy. However, while ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a grand story of scope and power, In the Name of the King feels small in more ways than one. "
593,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,30,Los Angeles Times," Its convictionless competence is merely dull, denying the pleasures of an outright howler without providing much else. "
594,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), Is this movie so god-awful bad that it's hilariously good? Can't be bothered deciding. Figure that's an answer in itself. 
595,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,25,Boston Globe," This is the sort of movie where men stand blankly over dead loved ones, then start digging. Masculine stoicism or emotional botox? You decide. "
596,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,25,The A.V. Club, Cultists will be happy to discover that In The Name Of The King bears all the so-bad-it's-good hallmarks of a classic Boll production. 
597,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,25,TV Guide Magazine," Director Uwe Boll sticks with what he knows -- how to turn video games into dull, cheap-looking movies. "
598,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,20,The New York Times," An awkward “Lord of the Rings” knockoff, it features both elaborate battles and bumbling humor, though it’s never quite clear when you should be laughing. "
599,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,11,Austin Chronicle," Who among us can explain the enigma wrapped in a riddle surrounded by fierce, ravening, razor-toothed conundrums that is German director Uwe Boll? "
600,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,10,The Hollywood Reporter," It's completely undone by its terrible screenplay, inept direction, oppressive musical score and muddy visual palette. "
601,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.9,10,Variety," A plodding patchwork of derivative fantasy-adventure, medieval production design, risible dialogue, unimpressive CGI trickery and haphazardly edited action sequences. "
602,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,60,Variety," Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick. "
603,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,60,The New York Times," Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle’s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam’s action choreography unusually witty. "
604,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (""Romeo Must Die"") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit. "
605,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,25,TV Guide Magazine," There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it. "
606,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,25,Boston Globe," This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us. "
607,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,20,L.A. Weekly, Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment. 
608,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,20,Los Angeles Times," Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown. "
609,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,16,Entertainment Weekly, Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad. 
610,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,0,The A.V. Club," The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk. "
611,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.9,0,Austin Chronicle, It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is. 
612,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,30,TV Guide Magazine," The tiny, impassive-faced Liu is a disaster. She looks cute in her custom commando gear, but she's not actress enough to make Sever's ridiculous, faux hard-boiled dialogue sound like anything but the formulaic nonsense it is. "
613,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,25,Miami Herald, Sometimes it seems as though Hollywood can't make a decent action movie anymore. Now that's a thought to make you go ballistic. 
614,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,25,New York Daily News," To pay for all the explosions and stunt work, the filmmakers must have decided to skimp on the screenplay. The rule of thumb is that one page of script equals one minute of movie, but there is so little dialogue in Ballistic that it could have been written on a matchbook. "
615,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,25,Baltimore Sun, The collateral damage of action products like Ballistic is to the sensibility of the audience. 
616,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,20,Variety," Remote, non-involving and finally incomprehensible. "
617,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,20,The A.V. Club," Looks like a video-game promo, has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show, and feels like a headache waiting to happen. "
618,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,12,Boston Globe," Banderas slums through this dollar-bin action flick wearing the same look of wiped-out exasperation that Danny Glover's Sergeant Murtaugh sports in each installment of ''Lethal Weapon.'' And like Murtaugh, Banderas might be too old for this, too. "
619,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,10,Washington Post," You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense. --It's almost completely uninvolving, as well as being impenetrable. "
620,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,10,The New York Times," The film isn't even as good as the second-rate game it is based on, which is nothing but a shootout. "
621,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.9,0,San Francisco Chronicle, Movies don't get much worse. 
622,Dance Flick,3.9,70,The Hollywood Reporter, The Wayans brothers manage to squeeze it all in to consistently amusing effect and in a way that just barely manages to stay within those PG-13 parameters. 
623,Dance Flick,3.9,63,Philadelphia Inquirer," The more pertinent question: Can the audience stick with this flick that showed most of its funny bits in the trailer? For the most part, yeah. "
624,Dance Flick,3.9,50,ReelViews," The best bits in this film fall short of being inspired, but they are outrageous. "
625,Dance Flick,3.9,50,Los Angeles Times, The miss-and-hit parodies score best when focusing on the Julia Stiles-styled girl next door. 
626,Dance Flick,3.9,50,USA Today, Dance Flick occasionally hits its mark with nimble execution. But too often it stumbles clumsily into bad taste. 
627,Dance Flick,3.9,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," An entertaining, moderately irreverent comedy that launches the silly movie season on a sure foot. "
628,Dance Flick,3.9,42,The A.V. Club, It would be hard to imagine a film with less going for it than Dance Flick. 
629,Dance Flick,3.9,40,Variety," This slapstick and scatological spoof settles for obvious punchlines, delivering just enough laughs to justify its existence without coming anywhere near the bar set by ""Scary Movie."" "
630,Dance Flick,3.9,30,New York Daily News," There's an art to making a good spoof, but good luck finding it in Dance Flick, not only because the movie goes for easy toilet humor, but because it often relies on it to stay afloat. "
631,Dance Flick,3.9,25,Boston Globe," If you thought the world couldn't get enough of bad spoof movies, you thought wrong. "
632,Swept Away,3.9,40,Variety, A simple misfire rather than a world-class fiasco. This misguided attempt to remake Lina Wertmuller's corrosive 1974 satire as a wistful romance is only unintentionally funny in the last reel. 
633,Swept Away,3.9,38,Chicago Tribune," One hopes that this is Hollywood's last go-round with Swept Away. Watching this fiasco, I kept having nightmares about a possible cartoon version, co-starring Cruella de Vil and Shrek. "
634,Swept Away,3.9,30,Los Angeles Times," Madonna may be better in this film than she's been in some of her recent endeavors, especially when she stops screeching her lines, but she's done herself no favors with her choice of material. "
635,Swept Away,3.9,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," No less laughable is the ending, where Ritchie neatly reflects today's prevailing attitude -- that audiences can't be trusted to handle a hint of ambiguity, but can live happily with flat-out stupidity. "
636,Swept Away,3.9,25,Chicago Sun-Times," A deserted island movie during which I desperately wished the characters had chosen one movie to take along if they were stranded on a deserted island, and were showing it to us instead of this one. "
637,Swept Away,3.9,20,Village Voice," Merely an indulgent vehicle for Mrs. Ritchie -- and Madonna is so spectacularly convincing as a hateful, self-absorbed, nouveau riche ogress that her character's third-act transformation is as preposterous as her overmuscled physique. "
638,Swept Away,3.9,20,Washington Post, At no point should anyone mistake this for an actual movie. This is an extended beach video that will leave no one swept away. 
639,Swept Away,3.9,20,The New York Times," There is no credible feeling here, no comedy, no eroticism. "
640,Swept Away,3.9,10,Salon," Isn't dubbed. But it sure feels like it. The characters open their mouths and their lips don't seem to be shaping the right words -- you can't believe any human beings would ever utter such ludicrous dialogue, with so little conviction. "
641,Swept Away,3.9,10,Washington Post," The film turns out to have nothing going for it at all, except a small charge for soul-deep Madonna haters. "
642,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,50,ReelViews," It's moderately engaging for the first half-hour, somewhat trying during the second half hour, and virtually unbearable over the final twenty minutes. It's a marginally recommendable film for kids, but not necessarily for parents. "
643,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,40,L.A. Weekly," Myers is the movie's fatal flaw, squeezing out the other characters who fatten the plot, mostly with an eye to parents. "
644,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,38,Chicago Tribune," Although a literal movie adaptation of Seuss' 1957 classic ""The Cat in the Hat"" might have run 20 minutes, is it too much to ask that the filmed material preserve the author's sensibility? "
645,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,25,Entertainment Weekly," Someone (Myers?) came up with the bright idea of turning the Cat in the Hat into the worst Vegas nightclub spritzer of 1958. He's become a furry version of Rip Taylor: a walking, talking vaudeville idiot box. "
646,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,25,Christian Science Monitor, It's a sort of soullessly cheerful cynicism that is about as far from Seuss as one can imagine. 
647,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,25,Rolling Stone, Talk about your quick-buck exploitation. 
648,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,25,Charlotte Observer," As a British politician said of a corrupt but articulate peer, ""The Cat in the Hat"" is like a rotten mackerel seen by moonlight: It shines as it stinks. "
649,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,25,Miami Herald, Charmless and grating and immediately forgettable. 
650,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,10,Dallas Observer, Such a remarkable rift between its charming source material and its heinous cinematic realization that the producers may as well have skipped the hassle of securing licensing rights and simply called this mess Mike Myers: A--hole in Fur. 
651,The Cat in the Hat,4.0,0,Village Voice, Comes scarily close to being the most unendurable Hollywood creation of the last dozen years. 
652,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,83,Entertainment Weekly," Far more grotesque than the first Human Centipede - in fact, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) could be the sickest B movie ever made. "
653,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,75,IndieWire," Like the original, the most shocking aspect comes from the revelation that Six can actually tell a story. "
654,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Whatever gothic originality the first Human Centipede possessed is altogether lacking in this sorry follow-up. 
655,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,25,Slant Magazine," The desire to eat someone's ass is almost always superficial; there's no thought of sustenance, and more sophisticated pleasures are usually imminent. Not so with The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). "
656,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,25,The A.V. Club, The first Human Centipede had audacity on its side. Human Centipede II has only excess. 
657,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,20,Variety," More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated. "
658,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,20,Time Out," The question remains: Exploitative films are a dime a dozen, but how low will two-faced art-film distributor IFC go? "
659,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,10,Boxoffice Magazine," Nasty and over the top, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) feels like a horror movie that hates horror fans. "
660,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,0,New York Magazine (Vulture)," The movie is a reductio ad absurdum, a sick joke taken to extremes, beginning with a goof on the notion that horror movies inspire copycats and ending with a test to determine whether some people will watch anything. "
661,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),4.0,0,Village Voice," It's perhaps the sequel we deserve. But that doesn't mean this dumb, blunt follow-up - both more unspeakably grotesque and less scary than the first film - is worth sitting through. Once Six's conceptual project becomes clear, his escalating audience-mocking torture is increasingly pointless. "
662,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,38,New York Daily News," Eddie Murphy's latest comedy, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, takes place in the year 2087, which is about the earliest he can hope to be forgiven. "
663,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,30,TV Guide Magazine," There are worse movies, but that's no excuse. Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment. "
664,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of. 
665,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,20,New Times (L.A.)," Only Quaid, as a semiretarded horny robot, and Cleese as a fussy chauffeur hologram seem to get it. Even Murphy, as the titular nightclub big shot in outer space, forgets to be actually funny until the climax. "
666,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,20,Austin Chronicle, In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused. 
667,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,20,Variety, The proper mix is never found. Ill-conceived and expensive project that winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it. 
668,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,20,Los Angeles Times," It's not awful, but the high cost of a movie ticket these days seems like a steep price to pay for 90 minutes of air conditioning and production design. "
669,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,10,L.A. Weekly, Murphy slogs his way through this dismally dull sci-fi comedy. 
670,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,10,The A.V. Club, A headache-inducing mess without direction or purpose. 
671,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,4.0,0,New York Post, So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines. 
672,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,60,Chicago Reader," Boorman deserves credit for trying out some new ideas, even if most of them backfire. Visually, it's fascinating—sort of a blend of Minnellian baroque and Buñuelian absurdity—but the dialogue is childish, the story is incomprehensible, and the metaphysics are ridiculous. Still, an audacious failure is preferable to a chickenhearted success. More than worth a look, if only out of curiosity. "
673,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,50,Variety," Since any title containing Roman numerals invites comparison, the answer is: No, Exorcist II is not as good as The Exorcist. It isn't even close. Gone now is the simple clash between Good and Evil, replaced by some goofy transcendental spiritualism. "
674,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,50,Time Out," Substantially recut by Boorman after his original version was derided in America, but it's still easy to see why New Yorkers jeered. Boorman completely avoids gore and obscenity, treating the original as a kind of sacred good-versus-evil text, and weaving its sets and characters into a highly traditional confrontation of occult forces. "
675,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,50,TV Guide Magazine," Not as awful as its notorious reputation would indicate, but certainly not the neglected masterpiece its small cult of supporters has claimed, Boorman's gorgeously shot sequel to The Exorcist has isolated moments of breathtaking imagery, but its parts do not add up to a satisfying whole. "
676,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,50,The New Yorker," The film is too cadenced and exotic and too deliriously complicated to succeed with most audiences (and when it opened, there were accounts of people in theaters who threw things at the screen). But it's winged camp--a horror fairy tale gone wild, another in the long history of moviemakers' king-size follies. There's enough visual magic in it for a dozen good movies; what it lacks is judgement. "
677,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,42,The A.V. Club, It would be a lot easier to buy Exorcist II: The Heretic as a mood piece if it was able to sustain a tone beyond clumsy exposition and hysterical camp for longer than a few minutes. 
678,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,40,Empire, A famously disastrous follow-up to William Friedkin’s horror hit. 
679,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,40,Rolling Stone, A snooze-fest without any scares. 
680,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,40,Newsweek," This sequel is so laden with dubious, spurious, curious and tedious stuff about theology, parapsychology, entomology and speleology that it forgets to frighten you in its frantic concern with being hip in the fad world of the occult. The Heretic simply drowns in its own malarky. [27 June 1977, p.61] "
681,Exorcist II: The Heretic,4.0,30,The New York Times, Exorcist II begins by looking foolish and slowly becomes a straightfaced film of the absurd. 
682,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,75,Philadelphia Inquirer," Graced with unusually expressive and seamless voice work by Drew Barrymore and George Lopez, the best of its kind since ""Babe."" "
683,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,70,The Hollywood Reporter," The picture might not be as fresh and clever as it could have been, but its spirited voice cast delivers the whole enchilada. "
684,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,70,L.A. Weekly," This being Disney, wholesome character-building messages abound, but for once they're freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine. "
685,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,70,Washington Post," Okay, the concept for the movie is admittedly lame, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with watching a passel of adorable pooches wrinkle their brows and bark while human voices come out of their mouths. "
686,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,63,USA Today," Alpo is served with a burrito chaser in Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Disney's fish-out-of-water comedy in which the fish is … well, read the title. "
687,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,60,Variety," A filthy-rich fantasy for these cash-strapped times, Beverly Hills Chihuahua features the voices of Drew Barrymore and much of the industry's top Latino talent in a live-action talking-dog lark that should please young pups. "
688,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," It's very slick and small children will enjoy it, but it has little of its model's special magic. "
689,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,42,The A.V. Club," This is not a movie for anyone who's aged past the ""Oh! Cute!"" phase of moviegoing. It's paced for little minds with short attention spans. "
690,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,30,Los Angeles Times," Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast. "
691,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,4.0,25,Entertainment Weekly," While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line. "
692,Caddyshack II,4.0,25,Chicago Tribune," It`s shoddy, lazy and numbingly stupid. "
693,Caddyshack II,4.0,25,Miami Herald," Beyond the anemic script, though, Caddyshack II fails because Dangerfield fits the character better. His bulging eyes and neurotic demeanor fuel his lethal jabs. Even though he's still the stand-up comic, his well-established routine makes it easier to believe him. [27 July 1988, p.D1] "
694,Caddyshack II,4.0,20,TV Guide Magazine," A disaster. Mason founders in his poorly written role, and none of the film's endless series of gags is the least bit funny. "
695,Caddyshack II,4.0,10,Washington Post," Caddyshack II, a feeble follow-up to the 1980 laff riot, is lamer than a duck with bunions, and dumber than grubs. It's patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet. "
696,Caddyshack II,4.0,10,The New York Times," The film features someone who walks like Jackie Mason, talks like Jackie Mason, does everything except make people laugh like Jackie Mason. "
697,Caddyshack II,4.0,10,Orlando Sentinel," This PG-rated romp is bland bananas compared to its R-rated predecessor. Besides, immediately following the liberating craziness of Animal House, another slob comedy didn't seem like such a bad idea. Now, after nearly a decade of slob comedies, the last thing we need is yet another, tamer one. "
698,Caddyshack II,4.0,0,Los Angeles Times," This movie is soooo bad (How bad is it?) that it makes ""Caddyshack I"" look like ""Godfather II."" "
699,Delta Farce,4.0,50,Variety," If three of ""The Magnificent Seven"" had been Gomer Pyle, the result might have looked like Delta Farce, a movie rife with fat, fart and Fallujah jokes, but with a subcutaneous wit that has a lot to do with Iraq war fatigue. "
700,Delta Farce,4.0,40,L.A. Weekly," You could make a case that any movie in which Mexicans and rednecks become best of friends is a net positive for society. But to do that, you'd have to ignore the severe boredom that sets in about halfway through this comedy. "
701,Delta Farce,4.0,38,New York Daily News, Dreadfully unfunny. 
702,Delta Farce,4.0,30,The New York Times," Perhaps the people most insulted are white Southerners, who presumably are expected to embrace one whopping brain-dead metaphor. "
703,Delta Farce,4.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The hilariously dirty insult comic Lisa Lampanelli shows up all too briefly as Engvall's shrewish wife. 
704,Delta Farce,4.0,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Delta Farce is so relentlessly racist (and homophobic), without ever having the intelligence to pass that bigotry off as satire, that viewers will be left thinking ""Borat"" has a soft touch. "
705,Delta Farce,4.0,25,New York Post, Larry the Cable Guy channels both Moe and Curly in the Three Stooges-go-to-war comedy Delta Farce. 
706,Delta Farce,4.0,25,TV Guide Magazine, Overall the movie is too stupid to offend any but the most sensitive viewer. 
707,Delta Farce,4.0,25,Boston Globe," Consider this the sequel to ""Ernest in the Army "" that the late Jim Varney never got around to making. It's not very good but at least it's not evil. "
708,Delta Farce,4.0,25,San Francisco Chronicle, A mindless comedy where the blatant racial stereotypes are outnumbered only by the flatulence jokes. The best thing that can be said about this movie is it falls just short of being an international incident. 
709,Prom Night,4.1,70,Variety, A surprisingly effective teen-skewing thriller that soft-pedals graphic violence (in marked contrast to the R-rated 1980 original) while generating a fair degree of suspense. 
710,Prom Night,4.1,50,TV Guide Magazine," Formulaic to the core, this reworking of the fondly remembered high-school slasher picture works surprisingly well on its own terms. "
711,Prom Night,4.1,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Without the gore, this old school slasher rehash is one anemic bore. "
712,Prom Night,4.1,30,Los Angeles Times," This is as listless, mindless and utterly useless a piece of corporate brain-clog as one is likely to come across for quite some time. "
713,Prom Night,4.1,25,ReelViews," Despite having the same title and a similar premise to a 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick (kids getting slaughtered on prom night), this is NOT a remake. In fact, it really doesn't have much of a plot. It's basically ""The O.C."" with a body count. "
714,Prom Night,4.1,20,L.A. Weekly," McCormick and screenwriter J.S. Cardone don’t have one original thought between them, but they do appear to share an obsession with characters opening hotel-room closets in which the steel hangers gleam ominously. "
715,Prom Night,4.1,20,The New York Times," The movie offers less gore than the average Band-Aid commercial and fewer scares than the elimination episodes of ""Dancing With the Stars."" "
716,Prom Night,4.1,16,The A.V. Club," There's really nothing much to Prom Night: No twists, no atmosphere, no big Grand Guignol setpieces, not a single moment when it tries to do something novel with the event, the killings, the villain, or the victims. It's a little like going on a tour of the slaughterhouse, where death is meted out with mechanical regularity, but visitors are kept at a safe, PG-13 distance from all the butchering. "
717,Prom Night,4.1,12,Boston Globe," When Jamie Lee Curtis ran from a killer in 1980's ""Prom Night,"" she was 22 and had a unique gift for belting out fear. She was the Beverly Sills of slasher flicks. That ""Prom Night"" was dumb, but it wasn't insulting in the way this remake is. "
718,Prom Night,4.1,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," A bland, timid and thoroughly un-thrilling teen thriller. "
