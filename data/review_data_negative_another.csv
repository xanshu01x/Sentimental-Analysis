0,Saving Christmas,1.5,40,Austin Chronicle," Saving Christmas will hold little interest for anyone not already a believer. It’s too single-minded in its instructional purpose, too averse to multidimensional characters, too youth-pastor-like in its dorky humor. "
1,Saving Christmas,1.5,40,Arizona Republic," Beyond the leaps in logic, the most troubling part of this film is that it just feels like a defense of the excess of Christmas. "
2,Saving Christmas,1.5,30,The New York Times, Saving Christmas seems determined to win any perceived war on Christmas through brute force. 
3,Saving Christmas,1.5,25,Chicago Sun-Times, This may be one of the least artful holiday films ever made. Even devout born-again Christians will find this hard to stomach. 
4,Saving Christmas,1.5,25,RogerEbert.com," Every holiday season sees a new influx of Christmas movies desperate to become the next big seasonal perennial destined to provide laughter, tears, humanity and healthy residuals for years to come. "
5,Saving Christmas,1.5,25,Washington Post, A glorified infomercial in defense of the holiday that contains about 15 minutes of actual content padded out with almost an hour of filler. 
6,Saving Christmas,1.5,20,Los Angeles Times, An unholy mess co-produced by Cameron's faith-based Camfam Studios. 
7,Saving Christmas,1.5,16,The A.V. Club," Preaching aside, though, Saving Christmas is a shoddy 80-minute feature that contains approximately 50 minutes of actual moving footage. When Cameron narrates that materialism doesn’t go against Christmas because it celebrates the son of God being made material himself, it sounds like a defense of any kind of cheap, poorly made holiday crap — this movie included. "
8,Saving Christmas,1.5,8,TheWrap," Director Doane offers no storytelling pizzazz; the lighting is careless, the pacing is deadly, the occasional stabs at comedy fall flat. Ultimately, Saving Christmas has nothing to share that Linus Van Pelt didn't already say better on “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” "
9,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,33,Entertainment Weekly," The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie & the Nottie, a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep. "
10,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,30,Washington Post," Like Nate, we are mere Notties. And we are supposed to feel oh-so privileged for getting to watch Paris through the glass. "
11,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Though Hilton may be a model, if her work in Hottie is any indication, she is no actress. "
12,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,12,Chicago Tribune, Verdict: not so hot 
13,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,12,ReelViews, A cinematic excursion so horrific that it's an insult to bad movies to call it a bad movie. 
14,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,12,Rolling Stone," That generous half star rating I tacked onto this comedy abomination is all for Paris Hilton. Come on, it takes guts (or gross dim-wittedness) to appear on screen again after ""House of Wax."" "
15,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,0,Village Voice," Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny. "
16,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,0,Variety," Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's ""Bottom 100."" The Hottie and the Nottie will make it an even four. "
17,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,0,The A.V. Club," How is Paris Hilton in her first starring role to receive a national release? Pretty bad, actually. She's limited to a single, all-too-familiar expression of smug self-satisfaction, and she delivers her lines in a tone somewhere between ""seductive"" and ""dish-soap commercial."" "
18,The Hottie & the Nottie,1.9,0,TV Guide Magazine," Preposterous, disingenuous, remarkably unfunny and genuinely distasteful. "
19,Disaster Movie,1.9,58,Entertainment Weekly," The movie is merciless sending up ""Juno's"" self-satisfied hipster gobbledygook, and it's quite funny to see Hannah Montana still promoting her tie-in products as she lies crushed and dying under a meteor. "
20,Disaster Movie,1.9,25,TV Guide Magazine," Lazy, superficially au courant and utterly forgettable. "
21,Disaster Movie,1.9,20,Variety," Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than Disaster Movie, yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce. "
22,Disaster Movie,1.9,20,The Hollywood Reporter, Real disaster movies have more laughs than this spoof. 
23,Disaster Movie,1.9,20,New York Daily News," Why would you watch a bad movie about better movies, when you could just rent the originals instead? "
24,Disaster Movie,1.9,20,The New York Times," Does little more than congratulate its audience on recognizing the source of its riffs. ""High School Musical"" -- ha ha ha! "
25,Disaster Movie,1.9,20,Empire," A horrific waste of time, money and oxygen. "
26,Disaster Movie,1.9,16,The A.V. Club," It's too easy to say Disaster Movie deserves its title, but why put more effort into trashing it than the filmmakers did into writing it? "
27,Disaster Movie,1.9,12,Boston Globe, The filmmakers are idiots. 
28,Disaster Movie,1.9,0,L.A. Weekly, This carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores. 
29,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,50,Entertainment Weekly," The film's moral? Turn off the TV, young 'uns, and go outside and play! And avoid Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 matinees while you're at it. "
30,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The sequel retains not only the same gimmicky premise as the original but its preference for cliche-ridden dialogue and flat-footed comedy as well. 
31,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,30,TV Guide Magazine, Entirely too convoluted for kids and implausible even by the standards set by the original concept. 
32,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,25,USA Today," Here's a late-August dog-days atrocity from the ""aren't farts funny?"" school of filmmaking. "
33,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,25,New York Daily News, Features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible. 
34,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,20,L.A. Weekly," As for anyone else who may experience a sudden need for therapy after sitting through this, you're on your own. "
35,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,20,Variety," Falls short on nearly every level, from production values to an inexplicable cameo by Whoopi Goldberg. "
36,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,20,Washington Post, So bad that I predict there will be drinking games set around viewing it someday. 
37,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,0,Dallas Observer," The first Baby Geniuses, released in 1999, was one of the most inane, humorless, ill-conceived, poorly acted comedies of the year. As difficult as it is to imagine, the sequel is even worse, earning an F. "
38,Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2,2.0,0,The New York Times," Villainy toward the infant class now comes from Jon Voight, descending to the depths of his 37-year-career. "
39,House of the Dead,2.0,50,Variety, Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on just how much 14-year-old boy you've got in ya. 
40,House of the Dead,2.0,40,Los Angeles Times," There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun. "
41,House of the Dead,2.0,38,New York Daily News," Director Uwe Boll wholeheartedly embraces the film's concept, and with some fancy editing and a pulsing soundtrack, the effect really is like watching a video game. "
42,House of the Dead,2.0,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Somewhere between cartoonishly bad for comic effect and bad because the filmmakers didn't really give a damn, The House of the Dead is, at least, unpretentiously dumb. "
43,House of the Dead,2.0,25,Boston Globe," House of the Dead, sadly, is so bad it's bad. "
44,House of the Dead,2.0,20,The New York Times," Does little more than add another title to the very long list of movies influenced by George Romero's 1968 horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" "
45,House of the Dead,2.0,20,The A.V. Club," Much poorly choreographed gunplay, many lovingly rendered head explosions, and some half-assed exposition about centuries-old, immortality-seeking pirates follow, with nothing to recommend House Of The Dead to anyone but the most undiscriminating zombie-movie fans. "
46,House of the Dead,2.0,20,Film Threat," Here’s a would-be horror film that contains not one ounce of professional pride in its making, not one shred of technical competence. This is one of the worst films of recent times. "
47,House of the Dead,2.0,20,The Hollywood Reporter, Laughable performances. 
48,House of the Dead,2.0,0,New York Post," Based on a video game, far exceeds expectations -- in negative ways that inspire thoughts of less than zero stars. "
49,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,40,L.A. Weekly," Full of gumption, Clarkson and Guarini soldier on, seemingy unaware that the perfectly adequate singing voices that brought them to the big screen are being drowned out, on a half-dozen same-sounding songs, by an overlayered backup group. "
50,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,30,The New York Times," They play cotton candy effigies of themselves named Kelly and Justin, and the best that can be said is that they don't embarrass themselves. "
51,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,30,Variety," The most resounding thuds in From Justin to Kelly, however, come from the musical numbers. "
52,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,25,Miami Herald," A feather-light musical rushed into production to capitalize on American Idol-frenzy, is nothing more than an excuse to give the two leads several musical numbers, a la those Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" movies, and with just about the same amount of substance, too. "
53,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," In this frothy beach movie, they make pop-music lite together but create an utterly unconvincing romantic couple, seeming more like siblings or best friends. From Ruben to Clay might work better. "
54,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,25,New York Post, Arguably the most insipid movie released so far this century. 
55,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,20,Dallas Observer," Aspires to be a ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" redux with a gangbang Grease finale, but it plays like junior high Neil LaBute filmed by an elementary school AV squad. "
56,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,10,Film Threat," Just one of those films, a bottomless well of snark fodder that may come and go in theatres but will surely be spun innumerable times on DVD at parties in the years to come. "
57,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,0,The A.V. Club," More than anything, From Justin To Kelly needs Simon Cowell, the fork-tongued Idol judge who gives the show its only sliver of tension. "
58,From Justin to Kelly,2.1,0,New York Daily News," More than awful, more than dreadful, and easily the worst beach movie ever made. "
59,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,42,The A.V. Club," The tired racial stereotypes that Caddy inserts into the old Caddyshack-style ""slobs vs. snobs"" formula should probably make it much more offensive than it is. "
60,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,40,Variety, An instantly forgettable trifle. 
61,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,38,New York Daily News, His C-Note is essentially a one-note character. And that note is flat. 
62,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Ultimately this is utterly forgettable stuff, not even managing to fulfill its mandate of mindless summer fun. "
63,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,30,L.A. Weekly," No, it’s not Caddyshack -- just swap Jews (Rodney Dangerfield) for blacks (Big Boi) and you’ve got Who’s Your Caddy?. The movie, of course, is terrible. "
64,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,30,The New York Times, There’s probably more wit and pointed social commentary in the average four-minute OutKast song than in the entirety of Who’s Your Caddy? 
65,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,12,Boston Globe," As it develops, Who's Your Caddy? just becomes depressing. You want to alert the United Negro College Fund: A mind has terribly gone to waste. "
66,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,11,Austin Chronicle, Must be counted as a forfeit. 
67,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,0,Film Threat, The sport of golf has seen its fair share of vulgar comedies over the last 30 years or so. 
68,Who's Your Caddy?,2.1,0,Washington Post," An offensive, comedy-free comedy. "
69,Glitter,2.2,60,Los Angeles Times," Glitter is the week's only major Hollywood release, and it offers considerable escapist entertainment while hitting an affirmative note. "
70,Glitter,2.2,40,L.A. Weekly," Glitter is, if nothing else, comfortable with what it is, namely earnestly made, wholehearted schlock. "
71,Glitter,2.2,38,New York Daily News," This is the worst performance by a pop star in a dramatic role since Madonna suited up for ""Shanghai Surprise."" "
72,Glitter,2.2,25,San Francisco Chronicle, It doesn't help that Glitter is such a derivative mishmash of cinematic and real-life situations that it's nearly impossible to count all the ways. 
73,Glitter,2.2,25,Entertainment Weekly," It's doubtful that even a real actress could have triumphed over the rusty tinsel of Glitter, a hapless, retro-'80s ''Star Is Born.'' "
74,Glitter,2.2,20,TV Guide Magazine," A butt-numbing exercise in tedium, sporadically redeemed by moments of unintentional hilarity. "
75,Glitter,2.2,12,Baltimore Sun, Glitter does no one any favors. 
76,Glitter,2.2,10,Variety," Glitter deserves yet another title: ""A Star Is Dull."" As phony a vehicle as one could possibly concoct for a wannabe movie star, pic carries Mariah Carey into a swamp of gloppy melodrama. "
77,Glitter,2.2,10,The New York Times," Mostly dross, an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clichés that illustrates the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication. "
78,Glitter,2.2,0,New Times (L.A.), Worst movie of the year. 
79,Son of the Mask,2.2,50,Entertainment Weekly," The characters twirl around like mini tornadoes, but between random brash moments of technological eye-tickling, Son of the Mask sags more than it spins. "
80,Son of the Mask,2.2,50,Miami Herald," In actuality, it's silly fun custom-tailored for reluctant young fathers and that entire clan of 20-something man-children who still read comic books and play video games, guys who do everything possible to resist the notion of adult responsibility. "
81,Son of the Mask,2.2,40,Village Voice," At its heart is a deep, unresolved ambivalence about child rearing. "
82,Son of the Mask,2.2,38,Chicago Tribune," Even with a new leading man and a more family-friendly rating, some things never change: The Mask still stars Industrial Light & Magic. "
83,Son of the Mask,2.2,30,Variety, The net result is a truly numbing experience. 
84,Son of the Mask,2.2,30,L.A. Weekly," Most of the animated sequences, capably mixed with live action, leave a bad aftertaste, particularly when the ultimate fate of one beaten and battered human bystander after another is left callously unresolved. In other words, parents beware. "
85,Son of the Mask,2.2,25,Christian Science Monitor, Cumming's antic acting is the only asset of this boisterous comedy. 
86,Son of the Mask,2.2,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Loud, mean-spirited and generally obnoxious, Son of the Mask makes the boisterous 1994 original look downright demure and refined. "
87,Son of the Mask,2.2,20,Dallas Observer, One presumes the only thing worse than making this disaster is actually watching it; wouldn't wish either on anyone. 
88,Son of the Mask,2.2,10,The New York Times," An irredeemable mess, a computer-animated Punch and Judy show without wit, heart or a single memorable performance. "
89,Alone in the Dark,2.3,50,Los Angeles Times," Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns. "
90,Alone in the Dark,2.3,30,Dallas Observer, Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired. 
91,Alone in the Dark,2.3,30,Variety," Fans of the source material probably won't be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup, and non-fans definitely won't. "
92,Alone in the Dark,2.3,25,Chicago Tribune," That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay. "
93,Alone in the Dark,2.3,25,Charlotte Observer," Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn't be overtaxed. "
94,Alone in the Dark,2.3,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen. "
95,Alone in the Dark,2.3,25,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead"") has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it's time for him to close up shop. "
96,Alone in the Dark,2.3,10,The Hollywood Reporter, One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it's still really bad. 
97,Alone in the Dark,2.3,10,Washington Post," This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they're in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs. "
98,Alone in the Dark,2.3,0,The New York Times," So inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash. "
99,Gigli,2.4,58,Entertainment Weekly," A watchable bad movie, but it's far from your typical cookie-cutter blockbuster. There are no shoot-outs or car chases, and there isn't much romantic suspense, either. "
100,Gigli,2.4,40,The A.V. Club," Writer-director Martin Brest lends the film a professional sheen, and his stars (who some rumors suggest may have become romantically involved) have charisma to spare, but the film has all the charge and momentum of a Paxil ad. "
101,Gigli,2.4,40,Salon," Turns out to be merely bad -- not a train wreck, not the crime against humanity it's been rumored to be. "
102,Gigli,2.4,38,Charlotte Observer," After five minutes, Christopher Walken vanishes. We wait vainly for the next 90 minutes for someone, anyone to bring that kind of danger, unpredictability and vitality to a story as drab as army fatigues. "
103,Gigli,2.4,25,New York Post," The problem with Gigli is that it is an inept attempt to do Elmore Leonard by Martin Brest, a filmmaker whose coarse sensibility makes him catastrophically unqualified to the task. "
104,Gigli,2.4,25,Baltimore Sun, Excruciating...The movie proves to be singularly unfunny and static almost from the non-get-go. Virtually nothing happens; the movie is all premise. 
105,Gigli,2.4,25,New York Daily News, Gigli is a disaster. 
106,Gigli,2.4,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," A hypnotic, black hole of a movie that sucks reputations, careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesn't star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded preening and bungled humour. "
107,Gigli,2.4,0,Wall Street Journal," The worst movie -- all right, the worst allegedly major movie -- of our admittedly young century. More stupefying follies may come, but it's impossible to imagine how they'll beat this one for staggering idiocy, fatuousness or pretension. "
108,Gigli,2.4,0,San Francisco Chronicle," The most thoroughly joyless and inept film of the year, and one of the worst of the decade. We're talking about a disaster, and not of the fun ""Showgirls"" variety, either. "
109,Epic Movie,2.4,40,The New York Times," The humor is coarse and occasionally funny. The archly bombastic score, by Edward Sheamur, is the only thing you might call witty. But happily, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard show up, as the White Bitch and Aslo the Lion, to add some easy, demented class. "
110,Epic Movie,2.4,30,Variety," If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, big studio Hollywood hitmakers should consider themselves lauded to the max in Jason Friedberg and Aaron Selzer's Epic Movie, the latest (and epically unfunny) entry in the movie parody franchise. "
111,Epic Movie,2.4,30,Chicago Reader," The cinematic equivalent of a tapeworm, this delivers few laughs beyond the initial chuckles of recognition. Seltzer and Friedberg (who also directed) have another script in development called ""Raunchy Movie""; apparently one idea they haven't yet considered is ""Watchable Movie."" "
112,Epic Movie,2.4,25,ReelViews," Epic Movie is a waste of time. It's like a bad issue of ""Cracked Magazine"" come to life. It's not so much painful as it is sleep inducing. "
113,Epic Movie,2.4,25,TV Guide Magazine," The sadists responsible for the painfully unfunny ""Date Movie"" (2006) are back, and this time they've outdone themselves: This theater-clearer is even less amusing than its terrible predecessor, a spoof so devoid of laughs it can longer be categorized as a comedy. "
114,Epic Movie,2.4,25,New York Daily News," Still, if it gets little else right, at least Epic Movie is accurately titled: It may be only 86 minutes long, but it feels as if it lasts forever. "
115,Epic Movie,2.4,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer must be stopped. For the last two years, this filmmaking team has created a series of spoof movies so feeble, shoddy and unfunny that they may be part of a diabolical, ""Manchurian Candidate""-like plot to stunt the intellectual development of American adolescents. "
116,Epic Movie,2.4,20,L.A. Weekly," By the time this dud drops on NetFlix, it'll be as obsolete as a Chia pet jokebook. "
117,Epic Movie,2.4,12,New York Post," This spoof of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and other recent blockbusters piles up sex gags, toilet gags and make-you-gag gags. "
118,Epic Movie,2.4,12,Boston Globe," The willful sloppiness and retrograde gags make Epic Movie, which was not shown to critics, an inevitable byproduct of our Internet video era. It seems downloaded and projected onto the screen, a failing online-film-school project paid for and put out by a Hollywood movie studio. That said, very little on YouTube is this unentertaining. "
119,Battlefield Earth,2.5,50,Chicago Tribune," Scientology or not, the movie is a battlefield bummer that makes you want to revolt. "
120,Battlefield Earth,2.5,38,Boston Globe," So heavy and lifeless that you keep waiting for those three little front-row kibitzers from ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" to appear at the bottom of the screen to start goofing on it. "
121,Battlefield Earth,2.5,30,Salon," Shot after shot photographed at wobbly, off-center angles for no particular reason, weigh every action sequence down with super-slo-mo in lame imitation of ""The Matrix"" or end every single scene with a vertical wipe. "
122,Battlefield Earth,2.5,20,Variety," Yet the overall look, though derivative (""The Matrix,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Waterworld,"" etc.), rates as Battlefield's one non-guilty pleasure. "
123,Battlefield Earth,2.5,16,Portland Oregonian," A ghastly, unappealing mess that lacks a single absorbing character, engaging story line or entertaining snippet of dialogue. "
124,Battlefield Earth,2.5,10,Film.com," The film is Travolta's baby, but indifference and boredom is everywhere. "
125,Battlefield Earth,2.5,10,Newsweek," The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden, and Roger Christian's directing choices are a lesson in sci-fi film cliché. "
126,Battlefield Earth,2.5,10,TNT RoughCut, The only danger in seeing this film is in busting a gut at its unintentional hilarity. 
127,Battlefield Earth,2.5,0,Film.com," In the pantheon of cinematic train wrecks, from ""Ishtar"" to ""Waterworld,"" set a place at the table for Battlefield Earth. "
128,Battlefield Earth,2.5,0,Rolling Stone," With this kind of epic ineptitude -- hell, the flick is set in the year 3000 -- you go for ""worst of the millennium."" "
129,Baby Geniuses,2.6,40,Film Threat, This movie wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It's still not that good though. 
130,Baby Geniuses,2.6,38,Chicago Sun-Times," Bad films are easy to make, but a film as unpleasant as Baby Geniuses' achieves a kind of grandeur. "
131,Baby Geniuses,2.6,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), About as endearing as unanesthetized gum surgery. 
132,Baby Geniuses,2.6,10,Chicago Reader, The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring. 
133,Baby Geniuses,2.6,10,L.A. Weekly," There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs. "
134,Baby Geniuses,2.6,10,Variety," A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film that proves you shouldn't beat a dead horse. "
135,Baby Geniuses,2.6,0,Entertainment Weekly, The worst movie of 1999. 
136,Baby Geniuses,2.6,0,The New York Times," One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close. "
137,Baby Geniuses,2.6,0,San Francisco Chronicle, A stupid comedy with toddlers talking like hip '90s grown-ups. 
138,Baby Geniuses,2.6,0,Austin Chronicle, Trying to encapsulate the movie's storyline is not possible; it doesn't appear to have one. 
139,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,70,The New York Times," May or may not appeal to fans of the Japanese fantasy franchise it is based on, but aficionados of apocalyptic teenybopper kung fu extravaganzas are in for a real treat. "
140,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,70,Village Voice," Far more entertaining than it deserves to be, unless you're a 10-year-old boy, in which case it's only the greatest movie ever made. "
141,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,50,Variety," A popular Japanese manga series gets a pleasing if paint-by-numbers live-action makeover in Dragonball Evolution, which half-heartedly tries to keep the faith for its pubescent male fanbase. "
142,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,50,Entertainment Weekly, Marvel at the fact that something this trippy made it to our local multiplex. 
143,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,50,Boston Globe," Nearly all the actors seem to be having a good time, and the action moves so fast that you don't mind when something nuts happens. "
144,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,42,The A.V. Club," The film is crammed with treats for old-school ""Dragonball"" fans, from the inclusion of all these characters (who don't actually do much) to the moment when spiky-haired Goku dons his orange gi. For everyone else, this amounts to another seen-it-before, probably-willing-to-see-it-again distraction. "
145,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,40,Los Angeles Times," Director James Wong (""Final Destination"") and writer Ben Ramsey are utterly blasé in their approach to the series' mythology and structure, cobbling together an 84-minute movie that seems to exist only to rile up fanboys. On that count -- and that count alone -- Dragonball Evolution triumphs. "
146,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,40,Austin Chronicle," Bottom line: costumed Goku and Chi Chi cosplayers may argue the finer points of this adaptation, but it is fairly dazzling it its own overextended, futurist-teenpulp fashion, and Chow makes a vastly more entertaining Roshi than he did a King. "
147,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,38,TV Guide Magazine," Just know there's a whole lot more great stuff out there than just what Evolution has in store for you -- namely, the anime that it was based on. "
148,Dragonball Evolution,2.6,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Completely lacking in visual, narrative or stylistic coherence, the film also suffers from cheap-looking visual effects and poorly staged and edited action sequences that will not exactly please the fanboys. "
149,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,80,Los Angeles Times," Exceptionally well-made family entertainment, this 3 Ninjas is constantly inventive, action-filled and funny, with a flourish of good special effects. "
150,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,58,The A.V. Club," The incredible silliness doesn’t quite erase the bad taste of this kid’s movie featuring an implied dozen civilian casualties, but it helps. "
151,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Pathetic yet stupidly entertaining for several minutes of its interminable running time, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain makes half its cast look like retreads and half like fresh ponies desperately karate-kicking a dud script to see if it has any signs of life. "
152,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,40,The New York Times," For most moviegoers over 12, this, the fourth Three Ninjas movie, will be interminably boring. But it's possible that young children will enjoy the film, since it falls into both the action category and the children-are-smart-adults-can't-do-anything-right genre. "
153,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,38,New York Post," As the fourth entry of a painfully uninspired series, this version features new actors portraying the trio of adolescent warriors. [10 Apr 1998, p.49] "
154,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,30,Variety, Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness in 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. 
155,3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,25,TV Guide Magazine, The best you can say is that it's all pretty harmless and pretty stupid. 
156,Date Movie,2.8,30,The New York Times," Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who wrote the screenplay, have crammed dozens of movie parodies into this deliberately juvenile spoof of romantic comedies. Mr. Seltzer, who directed, has made very few of them funny. "
157,Date Movie,2.8,30,L.A. Weekly," This anemic genre parody from two of the six writers of ""Scary Movie"" strives for the goofball precision of the brothers Zucker and, long before it reaches the end of its 70-odd minutes, gives you newfound respect for the comic genius of the brothers Wayans (two of the other writers of ""Scary Movie""). "
158,Date Movie,2.8,25,San Francisco Chronicle, A lame pastiche of Hollywood romances. 
159,Date Movie,2.8,25,TV Guide Magazine," The choice is yours: Shell out 10 bucks for this dire spoof of recent romantic comedies a la ""Scary Movie"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie"", or toss your 12-year-old nephew a quarter and get him to act out scenes from his favorite movies for 80 minutes: The entertainment value will be about the same. "
160,Date Movie,2.8,20,Variety," Arguably the lamest of all the free-wheeling genre parodies that have taken flight since ""Airplane!,"" Date Movie is stupefyingly unfunny in its attempts to mock romantic comedies, celebrities, reality TV shows and anything else that pops into the heads of its creators. "
161,Date Movie,2.8,20,Los Angeles Times, The only thing remotely resembling parody in this depressing waste of time and money is Jennifer Coolidge's sendup of Barbra Streisand as an over-the-top string of Jewish mother clichés. 
162,Date Movie,2.8,0,New York Daily News," ""Comedy is hard,"" said Steve Martin. For the writers of Date Movie, it's apparently impossible. "
163,Date Movie,2.8,0,New York Post," A collection of throwaway gags from other movies, a big blue recycling barrel of comedy waiting for the trash collector. It's rated PG-13 because 13 is the maximum age of those who might find it funny. "
164,Date Movie,2.8,0,Film Threat, Elapsed time before I walked out: 29 minutes Total laughs (in that period): 0 
165,Date Movie,2.8,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Date Movie is a good date movie in one sense: If you're still speaking to the person who brought you to see this, you just might have a future together. "
166,Meet the Spartans,2.8,58,Entertainment Weekly," Less classic Mel Brooks than middling ""Best Week Ever."" "
167,Meet the Spartans,2.8,38,Boston Globe," The best thing in Meet the Spartans is the swift kick in the bombast it delivers to the oh-no-not-us homoeroticism of ""300."" "
168,Meet the Spartans,2.8,25,TV Guide Magazine," The musical number that runs during the closing credits funnier than anything that precedes it, which isn't saying much. "
169,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer basically reprise the tired formula from their earlier efforts, which is to throw in as many pop culture references as possible to cover up the lack of any real wit. "
170,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,The New York Times, Overkill is what Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer do best: as the uncontested titans of the parody genre (with fingers in everything from the “Scary Movie” franchise to the more recent “Epic Movie”) they continue to prove that ridiculing other movies is much easier than making your own. 
171,Meet the Spartans,2.8,20,L.A. Weekly," Meet the Spartans is a mild improvement over their ""Epic Movie,"" which is like saying that a debilitating fever is more fun than appendicitis, but what’s shocking is how lazy it is, which is a shame for former UK child star/pop singer Sean Maguire, whose Gerard Butler impersonation is spot-on. "
172,Meet the Spartans,2.8,10,Variety," Lazy, lame and painfully unfunny, Meet the Spartans is yet another scrambled-genre parody. "
173,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,The A.V. Club," Meet The Spartans gamely alternates between unfunny gay jokes and violent pratfalls for a good 80 minutes, finding time for not one, but two musical dance numbers set to ""I Will Survive."" "
174,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,Village Voice," Witless, tasteless, formless spoof. "
175,Meet the Spartans,2.8,0,Austin Chronicle," Hey, guys, when you repurpose a disco hit to poke fun at gay men, not only do you look like assholes, you look like assholes who rip their jokes off of YouTube. "
176,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,42,IndieWire," The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) is just as repulsive, but far louder, and in color. "
177,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,30,Village Voice," Tom Six's threequel races to the bottom with abandon, all while indulging in tired wink-wink self-consciousness that includes Six himself showing up to witness his movie monster made real (and to be slandered by Laser as ""a poop-infatuated toddler""). "
178,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,20,New York Daily News," Neither Scary nor eye-rollingly fun, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) is the dullest entry in an atrocious trilogy. "
179,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,10,Variety," Six just wants to shock, though his imagination is so primitive that the effort is strained and a bit pathetic. Initially abrasive, the whole enterprise grows simply tedious well before the now-epically-scaled titular phenom is unveiled in the prison yard. "
180,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,Slant Magazine," Tom Six has achieved the seemingly impossible: He's made a film even less watchable than ""The Human Centipede II."" "
181,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,TheWrap," The thing that wrecks The Human Centipede III isn’t how the film is disgustingly, degradingly unclean; instead, Six’s work is ruined by how his film is desperately, depressingly unclever. "
182,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,The Dissolve, It’s only fitting that a series that began with the concept of linking the digestive tracts of three people would end by feasting on its own shit. 
183,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,The A.V. Club," The gross-out gore scenes and poop jokes are there, too, as is to be expected. The direction is bad, the acting is worse, and it’s lit to mimic the soap-opera effect on a poorly calibrated HDTV. Basically, The Human Centipede III is an unsexy ""Ilsa"" movie, and it’s just as impossible to sit through as that sounds. "
184,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,Entertainment Weekly," Even by the series’ already low standards, The Human Centipede Part 3 is crap. "
185,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2.8,0,Los Angeles Times," As horror, it's frightless and boring. As comedy, it's desperate and laughless. As exploitation, it's exceedingly dull. Even excrement was once something of substance. The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence is just rancid air. It too shall pass. "
186,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,30,The New York Times," Lorraine Gary has some affecting moments as Ellen, but Jaws the Revenge is mild and predictable, the very things an adventure movie should never be. "
187,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Jaws the Revenge is not simply a bad movie, but also a stupid and incompetent one - a ripoff. "
188,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,25,Chicago Reader," Angry fish travels to the Bahamas for the Christmas holidays, plotting revenge against the family of a vacationing New England widow (Lorraine Gary). Noel, noel, a charming gift idea with suggestions of inverted seasonal myth—until director Joseph Sargent swamps it all in antimythical literalism and predictable lunchtime theater. "
189,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,Empire," Significantly worse than the rest of the series, this film is one of the worst flops in recent cinema. "
190,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,Time Out London," While it's mostly just a matter of waiting till feeding time, there is a hint that somebody was trying to foist some Symbolism onto the shark: as mother and son suffer an attack of the Oedipals, the creature keeps popping up grinning. Sadly, this attempt at a bit of Art (which could have had hilarious consequences) is ditched, and the film concludes with a few people getting chewed before a messy happy ending amid chunks of exploding shark. "
191,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,TV Guide Magazine," Even the special effects are lame in this one, offering a latex shark that is about as realistic as a fake goldfish. Poorly directed by Joseph Sargent, who relies heavily on blood and fast editing to create tension since there certainly isn't any written into the script. "
192,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,Variety," Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine. "
193,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,Los Angeles Times," In a wicked mess of unmatched water shots and dreadful interior airplane sequences, the characters outlined in little blue halos, the performances range from the mortifying to the merely immemorable. Against all odds, Lance Guest and Karen Young manage to be warm and credible. Podgy but game, Michael Caine, bravely attempts mouth-to-mouth resusitation on a role which is little more than anecdotes strung together. It is not his finest hour. "
194,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,20,Washington Post," The director, Joseph Sargent, doesn't bring out any of the possibilities in the material -- not even the scary ones. And Michael Caine is wasted, though not completely. He manages to provide at least a little suspense, even if it's the extracurricular sort, by raising the question: Will an Oscar winner be allowed to become fish food? "
195,Jaws: The Revenge,2.9,10,Washington Post," There's more suspense in On Golden Pond. And when the predictable ending comes, it has none of the titanic man-versus-beast struggle of the original. It all happens so quickly, you wonder if you've missed something. But, no you haven't, because there it is -- the familiar calm sea . . . of credits. "
196,Kazaam,2.9,50,San Francisco Examiner," The movie is decidedly old-fashioned, aiming to send kids and their parents out of the theater feeling good about themselves. "
197,Kazaam,2.9,38,Chicago Sun-Times," As for Shaquille O'Neal, given his own three wishes the next time, he should go for a script, a director and an interesting character. "
198,Kazaam,2.9,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Is Kazaam racist? In effect, yes. But it'sracism linked to bad marketing: You can't really mix a black-pride rap film with a revamped version of ""Free Willie"" and expect them to magically jibe. "
199,Kazaam,2.9,33,Entertainment Weekly, It takes the movie all of 15 minutes to descend into sub-Spielbergian banalities about poor Max's search for his absentee dad. 
200,Kazaam,2.9,30,Los Angeles Times, The odd truth is that the film's novice star is better than the material. 
201,Kazaam,2.9,30,The New York Times, Memo to Shaquille O'Neal: Don't give up your night job. 
202,Kazaam,2.9,25,Christian Science Monitor," The plot is hamstrung by trite formulas, and there's too much violence and family tension for very young viewers. Shaquille O'Neal is likable as the title character, though. "
203,Kazaam,2.9,25,ReelViews," This is as witless as movies come -- an unamusing, moronic blend of horrible acting and inept screenwriting. "
204,Kazaam,2.9,25,San Francisco Chronicle," Original enough to come up with new ways to go wrong. For one, the film is a blatant showcase to promote O'Neal as a rap artist. "
205,Kazaam,2.9,0,Austin Chronicle," It's full of special effects that are big on smoke and noise, but short on logic and payoff. "
206,BloodRayne,2.9,40,L.A. Weekly," There are all sorts of noteworthy people in this silly vampire epic, including acting greats Sir Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin, but the only artist this critic wants to heap praise upon is the regrettably unidentified Supervisor of Blood Splatter: Nice work, dude. "
207,BloodRayne,2.9,40,Los Angeles Times," The only thing left unsliced is the ham in BloodRayne, yet another video game adaptation by German genre specialist Uwe Boll and a movie with more fading - or faded - talent than an Italian basketball team. "
208,BloodRayne,2.9,33,The A.V. Club," With minimal flare and maximal gore, Boll simply delivers the turgid drama and incompetently staged action sequences that have made him the unstoppable Big Boss of the gaming community. "
209,BloodRayne,2.9,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Attention, Ben Kingsley (I mean, Sir Ben Kingsley): It's officially time to turn in your Oscar. "
210,BloodRayne,2.9,25,Premiere, Yet another ill-conceived big screen videogame adaptation. 
211,BloodRayne,2.9,25,TV Guide Magazine, Why do moviegoers and gamers keep going to see video-game-based movies when neither group is ever happy with the results? 
212,BloodRayne,2.9,25,New York Daily News," While there's no fun in mediocrity, ludicrousness is another matter. Boll is the best at what he does, and what he does is make truly terrible films. "
213,BloodRayne,2.9,25,New York Post, Semicoherent. 
214,BloodRayne,2.9,20,Variety, Anemic action-fantasy. 
215,BloodRayne,2.9,0,Austin Chronicle," Maybe everyone involved was hoping that no one would see this movie, but Madsen is the only one who should fear anyone seeing his work. "
216,Rollerball,3.0,50,New York Daily News," The game itself is meaningless, and the movie, much the same way, likes it like that. "
217,Rollerball,3.0,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), What's up with director John McTiernan? The man has got to get a career of his own -- sponging off the pale leavings of Norman Jewison just won't do. 
218,Rollerball,3.0,30,Los Angeles Times," It's too bad this Rollerball veered off-track so swiftly, derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking. "
219,Rollerball,3.0,25,Baltimore Sun, There's something junior varsity about the whole sensibility that makes the new version seem more dated than the old one. 
220,Rollerball,3.0,20,The New York Times," The current version, however, like its predecessor, fails as entertainment. Mr. McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious. "
221,Rollerball,3.0,20,The A.V. Club," Only those attracted to ""Waterworld"" or ""Last Action Hero"" level big-budget disasters need bother with this one. "
222,Rollerball,3.0,12,Chicago Sun-Times," An incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense. "
223,Rollerball,3.0,10,Film Threat, Will surely end up as one of this year’s worst films. 
224,Rollerball,3.0,0,Miami Herald," Plentiful helpings of dreadful acting, confusing action cinematography, choppy editing and embarrassing dialogue, with the added bonus of a plot almost as dumb as that of the original film. "
225,Rollerball,3.0,0,Variety," Sheer chaos on wheels, a hysterically edited jumble that defies belief at nearly every juncture. "
226,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,42,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," This belabored summertime sequel is moderately less vulgar, certainly less expensive and, if possible, even less funny than its forerunning bomb, ""Daddy Day Care."" "
227,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,38,Miami Herald, A tired and unnecessary sequel. 
228,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,38,TV Guide Magazine," This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now-grown star of ""The Wonder Years,"" though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision. "
229,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,38,Boston Globe, Innocuous amusement for 5- to 8-year-olds and other people stuck in the anal stage of development. 
230,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Any scrap of charm or honest-to-goodness humor already possessed in limited quantities by the original has been relegated to the outhouse in this sorry follow-up. 
231,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,30,Variety," This sequel to the 2003 Eddie Murphy comedy may appeal to auds still young enough not to have seen it all before, or who still find flatulence hilarious, or who think adults, when agitated, flail about like epileptic marionettes. "
232,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,30,The New York Times," A recruiting poster for kids, insisting that there’s no domestic problem that military values can’t solve. "
233,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,25,New York Daily News," If you're looking for a modern-day ""Meatballs"" - or, for that matter, ""Meatballs 4"" - you're out of luck. "
234,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,25,San Francisco Chronicle," Too predictable, but kids should like it. "
235,Daddy Day Camp,3.0,12,New York Post," A comedy for no ages, has an amazing amount of CGI - Cuba Gooding Incompetence. "
236,Bratz,3.0,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Finally, a postfeminist multicultural musical extravaganza for 8-year-old girls. Is Bratz not the most totally stylin' movie ever? Grownups won't think so, but for their daughters who share a ""passion for fashion"" with the dolls that are giving Barbie a run for her money, it will be the event of the season. "
237,Bratz,3.0,42,Entertainment Weekly," A movie based on a doll line, is an M&M-colored high school fantasia for aspirational 10- and 12-year-old girls who'll be shocked (or, hopefully, delighted) when they get to ninth grade and find out life isn't so super-Bratz-fabulous. "
238,Bratz,3.0,42,The A.V. Club, Bratz's strong anti-clique sermonizing would be slightly more convincing if it weren't tethered to a movie romanticizing the most awesome clique ever. 
239,Bratz,3.0,40,Variety," Bratz’s references and parodies are consistently on-target, if always way too over-the-top. Every line of dialogue could plausibly take an exclamation point. "
240,Bratz,3.0,40,Washington Post," This is a movie for a grade-schooler's -- a female grade-schooler's -- sensibility. It's earnest, silly and sweet, with just enough food fights and musical numbers to keep everyone else from gagging on the goo. "
241,Bratz,3.0,38,USA Today, A silly movie that's essentially a series of clichés strung together into a semblance of a movie. 
242,Bratz,3.0,30,Village Voice," In the end, the most offensive part of Bratz isn't its stereotypes or brand expansion; it's the sorry state of Jon Voight's career. "
243,Bratz,3.0,30,Austin Chronicle, Bratz is way too long. 
244,Bratz,3.0,30,Los Angeles Times, It's a movie on the wrong side side of the so-bad-it's-good line. 
245,Bratz,3.0,0,Chicago Tribune," The most horrifying film of 2007, Bratz is based on the popular line of collagen-lipped, doe-eyed slut-ette dolls and their male companions, ""the boys with a passion for fashion ... and the Bratz!"" (In other words, they're bi-curious.) "
246,Left Behind,3.1,50,The Dissolve, The film’s appeal is largely dependent on Cage; Left Behind is a batshit-crazy Cage cult classic of a radically new stripe. 
247,Left Behind,3.1,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," It’s inoffensive, unless you take umbrage at the idea that the only people who know not to steal are True Believers and all that keeps society from an instant meltdown are the Faithful. "
248,Left Behind,3.1,35,TheWrap, Has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and production values that verge on parody. 
249,Left Behind,3.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The Rapture won’t come soon enough for the unfortunate souls forced to suffer through Left Behind. 
250,Left Behind,3.1,25,San Francisco Chronicle," That lack of concern for the way people actually interact renders the film useless as entertainment, or as a conversion tool. "
251,Left Behind,3.1,16,The A.V. Club," This Left Behind may be worse than the last Left Behind, but it’s much less boring, thanks in part to the commitment of its star, who plays the often ludicrous material with the straightest of faces. The Cage works in mysterious ways. "
252,Left Behind,3.1,10,Variety," With a “Sharknado”-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage, Left Behind is cheap-looking, overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order. "
253,Left Behind,3.1,0,New York Daily News," This failed epic — really, an epic failure — would barely be noticed, were it not for former Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage taking on a “Sharknado”-quality remake of a Kirk Cameron movie. "
254,Left Behind,3.1,0,Chicago Tribune," Cage is going for manly, if conflicted, family-guy confidence in this role, but somehow it comes off as nuttier than the events surrounding him. "
255,Left Behind,3.1,0,Entertainment Weekly," At best, Left Behind is shoddily made sensationalist propaganda — with atrocious acting — that barely registers as entertainment. At worst, it's profoundly moronic. "
256,Hercules in New York,3.2,38,USA Today," This unearthed cheapie and fast-forwarder's delight is redeemed by the dubbed- in cathedral tones (they're vintage gladiator pic) coming from our hero's larnyx. [20 Dec 1991, p.3D] "
257,Hercules in New York,3.2,25,TV Guide Magazine," For some reason, producer Wisberg decided to revive the long dead Hercules craze, and luckily it didn't take. "
258,Hercules in New York,3.2,25,Boston Globe," When you become a megastar like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you must expect your past to jump up and bite you - especially if you've made a stinker like this one. A great rental for frat parties, this Manhattan melodrama features Zeus sending Arnold, as Hercules, to present-day New York. [06 Dec 1991, p.62] "
259,Hercules in New York,3.2,25,Washington Post," It's a comedy to be laughed at rather than with, largely because the producers decided to dub Arnold's Teutonic voice with that of another actor, one who sounds like he's giving bus departure announcements at the Port Authority Terminal. [30 Jan 1992, p.C7] "
260,Teen Wolf Too,3.2,25,Chicago Tribune," Given the grosses of the original, a sequel to Teen Wolf was inevitable-and it was inevitable, too, that the sequel would lose the quality of innocence and unconscious artfulness that made the first film work. The material has been broken down, analyzed and reassembled with scientific precision; what was instinctive in the original has become self-conscious and calculated in the followup, and the spirit is gone. "
261,Teen Wolf Too,3.2,20,The New York Times," No one expects realism from a movie called Teen Wolf Too... still, the film makers could pretend to know what college is like, might try to liven up the kindly werewolf formula. "
262,Teen Wolf Too,3.2,12,Washington Post, Teen Wolf Too is nothing a jar of Nair wouldn't cure. 
263,Teen Wolf Too,3.2,10,Los Angeles Times," Teen Wolf Too embellishes its inane, cookie-cutter plot with remote direction, witless dialogue and charmless characters. "
264,Teen Wolf Too,3.2,0,Miami Herald," Teen Wolf Too is a relentlessly idiotic sequel to 1985's Teen Wolf. [1 Dec 1987, p.B5] "
265,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,100,San Francisco Chronicle," A flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the two other Chainsaw sequels seem like After-School Specials. [20 May 1995, p.E6] "
266,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,75,Chicago Sun-Times," Nothing at all is surprising about Next Generation except how enjoyable it is. It won't become a classic, but is quite a hoot, like the cockamamie Motel Hell, as funny as it is frightening. [29 Aug 1997, p.32] "
267,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,63,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," The other thing that sets this movie apart from the current crop of tongue-in-cheek screamers (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream) is that it's actually perversely intriguing, rather than just clever. [03 Nov 1997, p.C2] "
268,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,60,Variety, Manages the difficult feat of being genuinely scary and sharply self-satirical all at once. 
269,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,50,Austin Chronicle," Bits and pieces of the story will, on occasion, leave you scratching your head but it, nevertheless, moves rapidly enough to keep you scurrying to keep pace with the new business at hand. "
270,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,50,The New York Times," Its own efforts to be tongue-in-cheek, as with a backwoods gunman who quotes Emerson and Machiavelli, fall seriously flat. But should anyone have the patience to look closely, the two leading players do show signs of what would soon make them famous. "
271,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,50,TV Guide Magazine," Henkel's directing debut isn't incompetent: It's just derivative, pointless and tediously repetitive. "
272,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,50,The A.V. Club, A slightly above-average slasher film that's only partially redeemed by small but endearingly loopy shreds of black humor. 
273,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,42,Entertainment Weekly," The movie recapitulates the absurdist tabloid-redneck comedy of the great, original Chainsaw without a hint of its primal terror. "
274,The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,3.2,40,Film Threat, The bottom line is that the only Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie that you need is to see is the first. 
275,The Emoji Movie,3.2,40,Variety," There have been worse ideas, but in this case the execution isn’t good enough to bring the notion of an emoji movie to funky, surprising life. "
276,The Emoji Movie,3.2,30,The Hollywood Reporter," If not always imaginative or digestible, the look of the settings and characters should keep kids awake for 86 minutes; and if the trick that eventually saves the day makes very little sense to critical moviegoers, at least it's cutely frantic eye candy. "
277,The Emoji Movie,3.2,25,IndieWire, The most distressing aspect about The Emoji Movie is that a spectacle this self-evidently soulless no longer feels like a new low. It doesn’t even leave a dent. 
278,The Emoji Movie,3.2,25,The A.V. Club," There was probably never going to be a version of this film that would prove even remotely plausible as a movie someone felt passionately about making for artistic reasons; as far as expanding on smartphone-related IP, this is an even weaker starting point than Sony Animation’s recent The Angry Birds Movie. "
279,The Emoji Movie,3.2,10,ScreenCrush," There are plenty of words that can describe The Emoji Movie. Here are a few of them: Unfunny. Saccharine. Nonsensical. Painful. And, of course, crappy. (If you prefer the poop emoji, that works too.) "
280,The Emoji Movie,3.2,10,Screen International," A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps — and nowhere near as addictive — Sony’s animated The Emoji Movie is a calamitous comedy that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy. "
281,The Emoji Movie,3.2,10,Vox," The Emoji Movie is a waste of time, resources, and a bunch of comedians’ voices, plus a premise that actually had the potential to do some small good in the world. It’s less of a movie and more of an insult. "
282,The Emoji Movie,3.2,0,TheWrap," It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being. "
283,The Emoji Movie,3.2,0,New York Daily News, The only thing worse than the dialogue is the absurd product placement. 
284,The Emoji Movie,3.2,0,New York Magazine (Vulture)," It is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children. "
285,Slender Man,3.2,65,IGN," If the story behind this chilling internet creation could have matched the quality of those aforementioned strong points, Sony would have a real horror gem on their hands. "
286,Slender Man,3.2,42,The A.V. Club," In a movie this flat-out dull, even a tasteful lack of direct exploitation feels like a failure of nerve. "
287,Slender Man,3.2,40,Time Out, Give this literally and figuratively bloodless spooker a pass. 
288,Slender Man,3.2,40,Arizona Republic," The movie is a big disappointment, because ultimately Slender Man does not get the full-on creep-out treatment such an intriguing character deserves. Here he's just a generic horror bad guy, doing standard horror-bad-guy things. He could be anything, really, and therefore winds up, like the movie, being not much. "
289,Slender Man,3.2,38,Chicago Tribune," Birke's script is plainly straightforward, a simple supernatural chase story. It doesn't plumb the depths of what might make Slender Man scary, so Slender Man isn't scary at all. "
290,Slender Man,3.2,38,Movie Nation," Give White credit for the picture’s fairly eerie tone and look — darkened streets, foggy forests of spindly pines, shadows and more shadows. It’s just not worth more than the occasional hair-raising instant. "
291,Slender Man,3.2,38,RogerEbert.com," Sporadically, one can see the movie that Slender Man could have been, but it disappears like the title character’s victims. "
292,Slender Man,3.2,30,Variety," Slender Man is the kind of movie in which images come before logic, because there really isn’t much logic. There’s just a movie out to goose you. "
293,Slender Man,3.2,25,IndieWire," A tasteless and incredibly undercooked serving of the internet’s stalest Creepypasta, Slender Man aspires to be for the YouTube era what “The Ring” was to the last gasps of the VHS generation...there’s one fundamental difference that sets the two movies apart: “The Ring” is good, and Slender Man is terrible. "
294,Slender Man,3.2,20,The New York Times, The most perfunctory horror picture I’ve seen in some time. 
295,Barb Wire,3.3,70,Washington Post," David Hogan keeps the action moving and loaded with fights, gun battles and other action-trashy thrills. Lee is terrific. "
296,Barb Wire,3.3,70,Washington Post," Lee elevates herself from the lower echelon of mere international super-babedom to the loftier realm of pulp myth. She is ""It"" with an exclamation mark. "
297,Barb Wire,3.3,63,Chicago Sun-Times," The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. Barb Wire has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun. "
298,Barb Wire,3.3,50,Austin Chronicle," It's a comic book movie in the broadest sense of the term, and although it's neither as emotionally resonant as ""The Crow"" nor as surreally goofy as ""Tank Girl,"" Barb Wire still manages to get you going, Anderson Lee fan or not. "
299,Barb Wire,3.3,40,Los Angeles Times," Ought to be disreputable fun. Instead it ends up, all its explosions and exposed flesh notwithstanding, rather inert. "
300,Barb Wire,3.3,40,The New York Times, Isn't much when it comes to either deliberate or inadvertent humor. But it does have a few amusing moments. 
301,Barb Wire,3.3,40,Chicago Reader," Its main source is a comic book, but it might as well be a computer. "
302,Barb Wire,3.3,25,ReelViews," The element of high camp that makes for enjoyable ""good trash"" isn't present. "
303,Barb Wire,3.3,25,San Francisco Chronicle," A convoluted mess, but there have been worse. "
304,Barb Wire,3.3,25,San Francisco Examiner, Muddled futuristic thriller. 
305,Feardotcom,3.3,50,Chicago Sun-Times," Strange, how good feardotcom is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see. "
306,Feardotcom,3.3,40,New Times (L.A.)," If sudden loud noises, relentless strobe lights, digital hallucinations and mutilated corpses make you jump, and you feel that nothing more is required for a good time at the movies, welcome to Feardotcom. "
307,Feardotcom,3.3,40,Variety," Never quite realizes its potential to evoke the real horror of the Internet -- Yet, Malone has given the film a distinctive atmosphere and occasional flashes of his perverse sense of humor. "
308,Feardotcom,3.3,30,TV Guide Magazine," There's a germ of an interesting idea here, but it's smothered by gloomy cinematography a la ""Seven"" (1995) and grating implausibilities, like the fact that everyone lives in the kind of cavernous, dankly art-directed dumps that only internet millionaires and trust fund twinkies can afford in the real New York. "
309,Feardotcom,3.3,25,New York Post," A low-rent, slow-witted horror flick notable chiefly for its hilariously unsuccessful attempt to pass off Luxembourg City as New York City. "
310,Feardotcom,3.3,25,New York Daily News," The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly. "
311,Feardotcom,3.3,20,The A.V. Club," Made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises, but it's quickly apparent that there's no thought or originality under its grim, familiar surface. "
312,Feardotcom,3.3,10,Film Threat," This movie is plain stupid from the get go, but at least it looks good. "
313,Feardotcom,3.3,10,Los Angeles Times," The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene, and it makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if they're trying to remain unrecognized. "
314,Feardotcom,3.3,10,L.A. Weekly," The film, whose clumsy editing and dearth of establishing shots keep the viewer in an unintended state of confusion, is a corpse in its own right: It’s filled with the rotting ideas of far better movies. "
315,The Master of Disguise,3.3,25,Philadelphia Inquirer, Totally lame. 
316,The Master of Disguise,3.3,25,Baltimore Sun," Hands-down, the best James Brolin-in-an-Italian-accent movie ever. "
317,The Master of Disguise,3.3,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line after barely 65 minutes of movie, and then follows it with 15 minutes of end credits in an attempt to clock in as a feature film. "
318,The Master of Disguise,3.3,25,USA Today," Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie. "
319,The Master of Disguise,3.3,20,Chicago Reader," Imagine combining bad imitations of the ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Austin Powers"" movies and you'll have a rough idea of this feeble Dana Carvey farce. "
320,The Master of Disguise,3.3,20,Variety," Vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy, colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10. "
321,The Master of Disguise,3.3,20,TV Guide Magazine, Painfully unfunny and misguided to boot. 
322,The Master of Disguise,3.3,20,New Times (L.A.)," Mostly this happy train wreck feels like a longer, better movie that was chopped up and reassembled by retarded monkeys; what should have been a rush instead feels rushed. "
323,The Master of Disguise,3.3,16,Entertainment Weekly," An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill ''Saturday Night Live'' skits. "
324,The Master of Disguise,3.3,0,New York Post," No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise, an unbearably tedious and unfunny comedy. "
325,Catwoman,3.3,67,Entertainment Weekly," I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed. "
326,Catwoman,3.3,50,Dallas Observer," Much like a cat, the movie is a superfluous gob of fluff with an attitude ranging from idiotic to nasty. "
327,Catwoman,3.3,38,Philadelphia Inquirer," Catwoman, which talks about the ""duality"" inside all women (wild vs. docile, rapacious vs. cuddly), does have its guilty pleasures. Most of these come courtesy of ice queen Stone. "
328,Catwoman,3.3,30,Village Voice," Like the action movies of yore (you know, the 1980s), Catwoman is simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished. "
329,Catwoman,3.3,30,The New York Times," A howlingly silly, moderately diverting exercise in high, pointless style. "
330,Catwoman,3.3,30,L.A. Weekly," What the movie needs is a director, and what it gets instead is Pitof, a French visual-effects maestro so much fonder of technological wizardry than of human flesh that he manages to turn even his slinky, sinuous star attraction into a digitized synthespian frolicking about endless CGI cityscapes. "
331,Catwoman,3.3,25,ReelViews, A catastrophe. This motion picture is an embarrassment to all involved. 
332,Catwoman,3.3,25,Charlotte Observer," Pitof can be blamed for the 89-cent digitized sets, the jerky or rubbery special effects, some clunky performances and more continuity errors than I could count. "
333,Catwoman,3.3,25,Christian Science Monitor, Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip. 
334,Catwoman,3.3,25,Miami Herald," Silly, tedious, inept disaster. "
335,Jack and Jill,3.3,63,Boston Globe," What's more genuinely wacky is what a kick the movie can sometimes be, completely in spite of its big, flat stunt. "
336,Jack and Jill,3.3,40,New York Daily News," There are moments in Jack and Jill that are genuinely funny - and, just like countless family reunions, there are moments when you can't wait for it to end. "
337,Jack and Jill,3.3,38,Orlando Sentinel," Then there's Pacino, out-of-place and yet somehow right at home. You want big? Al does BIG. And since is as close as we're likely to get to ""Don Corleone Does Don Quixote,"" that alone is worth the price of admission. "
338,Jack and Jill,3.3,30,The New York Times," There are a few funny moments in Jack and Jill, most of them celebrity cameos that also serve to affirm what a cool, connected celebrity Mr. Sandler is. The most sustained of these is the appearance of Al Pacino as himself, falling for Jill and giving the film a jolt of genuine zaniness. I'm sorry to say that this may be Mr. Pacino's most convincing performance in years. "
339,Jack and Jill,3.3,25,Miami Herald, Jack and Jill contains long stretches of squirm-inducing tedium in which Sandler riffs and ad-libs far longer than he should. 
340,Jack and Jill,3.3,25,Washington Post," The unapologetic laziness and ineptitude of Jack's impersonation, which is played for cheap laughs, is just as lazy as Sandler's performance as the real Jill. You don't buy it for a minute. "
341,Jack and Jill,3.3,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Jack and Jill is witless and sloppily constructed, getting by on fart gags, homeless jokes, Latino stereotypes and that old favorite, explosive chimichanga diarrhea -- and no, not in an inspired ""Bridesmaids"" way. "
342,Jack and Jill,3.3,12,Slant Magazine," If the result is a movie that seems like a much slicker, more condensed, and speedier version of the Sandler comedies that have guaranteed his grandkids' retirement, count it as a blessing that it's over quickly. Not without pain, but quickly. "
343,Jack and Jill,3.3,12,USA Today," A comedy that has one good joke, four strange cameos and a spirit so juvenile kids may wonder what Sandler's deal is. "
344,Jack and Jill,3.3,0,Rolling Stone," A total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement. "
345,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,30,Movieline," That Bucky Larson's humor is stuck at a toilet-centric grade school level is less damning than how little of that or any humor it contains - the film, directed by Tom Brady (The Hot Chick), sets up scene after scene that wanders around in the general vicinity of a joke idea without ever approaching anything like a punchline. "
346,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,25,Entertainment Weekly, Bucky Larson is a one-note joke played over and over and over. 
347,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,25,Orlando Sentinel," It's an ugly movie to look at and a faintly nauseating one to sit through, truth be told. "
348,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,25,Boston Globe," Never thought we'd say this about a movie, but Bucky Larson probably doesn't wring as much out of recurring bodily-fluid gags as it could. "
349,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,20,Los Angeles Times," The scenario makes for an inept, lazy R-rated movie whose sole purpose is as a glossary of euphemisms for genitalia and sexual acts. "
350,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,16,The A.V. Club," Apparently no one told Ricci she was acting in a comedy, not a touching drama about a young woman overcoming a formative trauma to achieve her dreams. "
351,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,10,The Hollywood Reporter," Unfortunately, the R rating will prohibit the target audience -- namely teenage boys who find penis jokes endlessly hilarious - from seeing this relentlessly unfunny and vulgar effort until it shows up on video and cable. "
352,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,10,The New York Times, This may be the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever been in. Think about that. 
353,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,10,New York Daily News," This god-awful, unfunny, stinkingly putrid sketch-comic movie has exactly one snicker-worthy moment, involving Kevin Nealon and a stolen grape. But watching the rest of it will make you whine. "
354,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,3.3,10,Variety, One of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year. 
355,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.4,40,TV Guide Magazine," Since all these revisited series have run out of steam, this sorry sequel is only recommended for aging nostalgists. "
356,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.4,20,Empire," Energetically humourless, with travelogue and circus footage inserted between the dog-piss and big boob jokes. "
357,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.4,10,Variety," An inept, geriatric romp that's for completists only. "
358,Police Academy: Mission to Moscow,3.4,0,Time Out," Lame, sloppy, cack-handed, utterly redundant - put succinctly, the very worst of the series. "
359,Crossroads,3.4,50,New Times (L.A.)," Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply, but those who loved ""Cool as Ice"" have at last found a worthy follow-up. "
360,Crossroads,3.4,40,Slate, So vanilla yet so transcendentally sleazy that its target audience seems to be pubescent girls and dirty old priests. 
361,Crossroads,3.4,40,Film Threat," Spears, Davis, and company are well aware that they're making nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of Spears' glossy bubble gum pop -- but that's exactly the problem. "
362,Crossroads,3.4,40,Salon," The movie is a lumbering load of hokum, but unlike those other recent pop star white elephants -- it's at least watchable. "
363,Crossroads,3.4,38,USA Today, Less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip. 
364,Crossroads,3.4,30,The New Yorker," What it's really about, of course, is the very delicate marketing problem of turning a super-bland pop star into an acceptable human being onscreen. [4 Mar 2002, p. 90] "
365,Crossroads,3.4,20,The A.V. Club," Spears is filmed and costumed in such a harsh, unflattering manner that it looks like Christina Aguilera bribed the crew to make her rival look as hideous as possible. Spears' ubiquity has spawned an inevitable backlash, but the awful Crossroads ought to do more harm to her career than even the most powerful Britney-basher. "
366,Crossroads,3.4,20,Variety, Awfully lame bigscreen debut for pop diva Britney Spears. 
367,Crossroads,3.4,0,Baltimore Sun," Go see Crossroads if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs. "
368,Crossroads,3.4,0,Washington Post, It does wonders to a critic to know that [Britney] could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come. 
369,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,60,Film Threat," Sure, Dumb and Dumberer is dumb, dumber and dumberer than the original, but if you like that kind of banal, rustic and sophomoric humor (and I have to admit, I kinda do), it might be worth a buck or two at a discount theater. "
370,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,38,New York Daily News," The movie's really about the impressions of the original performances by newcomers Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Olsen does an uncanny Carrey, and Richardson vaguely resembles Daniels. "
371,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,30,Los Angeles Times, Falls wildly short of its inspirations. 
372,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Long, lumbering and endlessly unfunny. "
373,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,25,USA Today," In ""There's Something About Mary,"" the gross gags were hilarious. Here, they're just vile. "
374,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,25,Portland Oregonian," Has all the gross-out humor but none of the goofy sweetness. It also has neither of the Farrellys, which is agonizingly evident throughout. "
375,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,20,L.A. Weekly," Levy, Luis Guzman, Cheri Oteri -- utterly wasted. At 82 minutes it feels longer than “Lawrence of Arabia” -- and a lot less funny. "
376,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,20,Chicago Reader," The best thing I can say about this limp prequel to the Farrelly brothers' Dumb & Dumber is that it obliged me to check out the original, which I'd been studiously avoiding for years. If you haven't seen it, it's pretty funny, and mercifully light on the scatology and cheap sentiment of later Farrelly efforts. "
377,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,10,Washington Post," To call it sophomoric would libel even the most pathetic, pimply underclassman. "
378,Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,3.4,0,Austin Chronicle," Even with its scant running time, this nightmarish travesty barrels along with all the whipcord speed and nimble comedic grace of a loved one’s funeral. "
379,Vampires Suck,3.4,42,Tampa Bay Times," After a lucrative career of bashing well-made scary, epic, disaster and date movies, Friedberg and Seltzer have a source begging to be mocked. "
380,Vampires Suck,3.4,40,The New York Times," This pointless parody dumps us in the fictional town of Sporks, Wash., a location lousy with vampires and werewolves. "
381,Vampires Suck,3.4,30,Boxoffice Magazine," As if a string of bad jokes wasn't enough, Vampires Suck is full of distractingly forced pop culture references and shameless product placements (the actors practically mug for the camera while holding various products). "
382,Vampires Suck,3.4,30,The Hollywood Reporter," The main performers do a reasonably good job of parodying the ""Twilight"" leads, with Proske particularly effective in subtly lampooning Kristen Stewart's moody mannerisms. "
383,Vampires Suck,3.4,30,Arizona Republic," Two very important things to note about Vampires Suck: The film is a spoof of the ""Twilight"" movies, and the title is a good indication of where the level of wit lies. "
384,Vampires Suck,3.4,25,Orlando Sentinel," If Kristen Stewart ever saw Vampires Suck, she'd be scarred for life. "
385,Vampires Suck,3.4,25,San Francisco Chronicle, That Vampires Suck is a step above god-awful is something of a miracle. 
386,Vampires Suck,3.4,25,The A.V. Club," The boys similarly deserve very minor props for choosing a satirical target that lends itself to satire: the glum, self-important Twilight novels and movies. Sadly, that's where the filmmakers' mild accomplishments end and the groaningly predictable hackwork begins. "
387,Vampires Suck,3.4,20,Variety," The lame mediocrity of Vampires Suck undeniably reps an advance for writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By just about any other standard, however, this instantly forgettable trifle is fairly close to worthless. "
388,Vampires Suck,3.4,12,Washington Post," Vampires suck? That's a matter of opinion. But here's what inarguably, unequivocally does suck: Vampires Suck. "
389,Spice World,3.5,100,San Francisco Chronicle," A joyous, hilarious send-up of rock star pretensions and an enchanting celebration of ""girl power"" in pop culture. "
390,Spice World,3.5,75,San Francisco Examiner," Without much of a plot to speak of and relying almost entirely on the girls' star power and charisma - which they have in spades - turns out to be a truly entertaining movie for anyone with even a bare knowledge of the Spice Girls' history, which in this age of absolute over-saturation, is hard to avoid. "
391,Spice World,3.5,70,The New York Times," Disarmingly, the film thus acknowledges the Spice Girls' flash-in-the-pan status and lets them kid around about their frankly synthetic career. "
392,Spice World,3.5,50,ReelViews," Although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles' classic, it's several long strides behind, lacking the same sense of originality, spontaneity, high energy, and joi de vivre. "
393,Spice World,3.5,50,Entertainment Weekly," Shabbily filmed, thoroughly harmless Official Product. "
394,Spice World,3.5,50,Salon," There are several non sequitur subplots woven together -- and that, along with a dearth of acting talent, is Spice World's biggest flaw. "
395,Spice World,3.5,30,Austin Chronicle," Bad as it may be, though, the film falls that one precious inch shy of being quite so awful that it achieves cult status; in short, it's just not bad enough to be any good. "
396,Spice World,3.5,20,Chicago Reader," A promotional tool that establishes its superfluousness simply by existing, this clumsy, smirking movie has a bitter soul. "
397,Spice World,3.5,12,Chicago Sun-Times, They're so detached they can't even successfully lip-synch their own songs. 
398,Spice World,3.5,10,Dallas Observer, Rarely has one movie seemed so predestined to reduce any and all attempted criticism to so many column inches of impotent gibberish. 
399,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,70,L.A. Weekly, Slight but immensely enjoyable charmer. 
400,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,60,Dallas Observer, Robert Rodriguez and his kids conjure up a charming 3-D fantasy. 
401,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,50,The Hollywood Reporter, An often imaginative though less than magical family feature. 
402,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,50,Variety," There's little chance of grabbing teens (or even many tweens) during summertime playdates. Still, small fry will be enchanted by this rambunctious action-adventure. "
403,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,42,Entertainment Weekly," Like choral singing and travel photography, this adventure is more fun for participants than it is for spectators. "
404,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,38,Chicago Tribune, There's really just not a lot here. I'm sure Racer's story will entertain the very wee ones -- but so do keys. 
405,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,38,Charlotte Observer, The story's so sloppy that it contradicts itself constantly. 
406,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,30,Time," Pretty lame. Sharkboy has an especially frantic, amateur atmosphere, with a mostly maladroit cast. "
407,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,30,Village Voice," Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside ""100%"" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA. "
408,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,30,The A.V. Club," Sadly, the film's creaky, sometimes painful dialogue makes it all too easy to believe that it was genuinely co-written by a small child. "
409,Scary Movie 5,3.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter, This latest installment of the horror movie spoof franchise is mainly notable for its Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Lohan cameos. 
410,Scary Movie 5,3.5,30,The New York Times," Marlon Wayans’s satire “A Haunted House” got to “Paranormal” first, and for a much smaller budget delivered bigger laughs. "
411,Scary Movie 5,3.5,25,McClatchy-Tribune News Service, Scary Movie 5 comes up short in every way imaginable. 
412,Scary Movie 5,3.5,25,The A.V. Club," Scary Movie 5 aspires to timeliness, but its comic sensibility is so groaningly retro that the film features a series of tributes to The Benny Hill Show and its signature ditty, “Yakety Sax.” "
413,Scary Movie 5,3.5,25,Entertainment Weekly," Somehow, it actually looks cheaper than ""Paranormal Activity."" It's less funny, too. "
414,Scary Movie 5,3.5,25,New York Post, This is a horror movie that’s really a supposed comedy; she’s (Lohan) a supposed comedy actress who’s actually scary. 
415,Scary Movie 5,3.5,20,New York Daily News," Luckily, folks like Snoop and good sports like Sheen and, yes, Lohan, break up the monotony. Until, like an undead beastie, the boredom and dumb jokes come roaring back. "
416,Scary Movie 5,3.5,20,Empire," Lacking a single honest laugh, this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels… which throws it in a pit with Transylmania, Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing. "
417,Scary Movie 5,3.5,10,Variety," Audiences not inclined to laugh at the sight of a baby’s head catching fire are encouraged to at least chuckle at the various gags made at the expense of Jody and Dan’s housekeeper (a game Lidia Porto), who satisfies many of the picture’s comedic-target prerequisites by being plus-sized, hysterically religious and Latina. "
418,Scary Movie 5,3.5,5,Film.com," Scary Movie 5 is so massively un-enjoyable, a hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator. "
419,Delta Farce,3.5,50,Variety," If three of ""The Magnificent Seven"" had been Gomer Pyle, the result might have looked like Delta Farce, a movie rife with fat, fart and Fallujah jokes, but with a subcutaneous wit that has a lot to do with Iraq war fatigue. "
420,Delta Farce,3.5,40,L.A. Weekly," You could make a case that any movie in which Mexicans and rednecks become best of friends is a net positive for society. But to do that, you'd have to ignore the severe boredom that sets in about halfway through this comedy. "
421,Delta Farce,3.5,38,New York Daily News, Dreadfully unfunny. 
422,Delta Farce,3.5,30,The New York Times," Perhaps the people most insulted are white Southerners, who presumably are expected to embrace one whopping brain-dead metaphor. "
423,Delta Farce,3.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter, The hilariously dirty insult comic Lisa Lampanelli shows up all too briefly as Engvall's shrewish wife. 
424,Delta Farce,3.5,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Delta Farce is so relentlessly racist (and homophobic), without ever having the intelligence to pass that bigotry off as satire, that viewers will be left thinking ""Borat"" has a soft touch. "
425,Delta Farce,3.5,25,New York Post, Larry the Cable Guy channels both Moe and Curly in the Three Stooges-go-to-war comedy Delta Farce. 
426,Delta Farce,3.5,25,TV Guide Magazine, Overall the movie is too stupid to offend any but the most sensitive viewer. 
427,Delta Farce,3.5,25,Boston Globe," Consider this the sequel to ""Ernest in the Army "" that the late Jim Varney never got around to making. It's not very good but at least it's not evil. "
428,Delta Farce,3.5,25,San Francisco Chronicle, A mindless comedy where the blatant racial stereotypes are outnumbered only by the flatulence jokes. The best thing that can be said about this movie is it falls just short of being an international incident. 
429,Dance Flick,3.5,70,The Hollywood Reporter, The Wayans brothers manage to squeeze it all in to consistently amusing effect and in a way that just barely manages to stay within those PG-13 parameters. 
430,Dance Flick,3.5,63,Philadelphia Inquirer," The more pertinent question: Can the audience stick with this flick that showed most of its funny bits in the trailer? For the most part, yeah. "
431,Dance Flick,3.5,50,ReelViews," The best bits in this film fall short of being inspired, but they are outrageous. "
432,Dance Flick,3.5,50,Los Angeles Times, The miss-and-hit parodies score best when focusing on the Julia Stiles-styled girl next door. 
433,Dance Flick,3.5,50,USA Today, Dance Flick occasionally hits its mark with nimble execution. But too often it stumbles clumsily into bad taste. 
434,Dance Flick,3.5,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," An entertaining, moderately irreverent comedy that launches the silly movie season on a sure foot. "
435,Dance Flick,3.5,42,The A.V. Club, It would be hard to imagine a film with less going for it than Dance Flick. 
436,Dance Flick,3.5,40,Variety," This slapstick and scatological spoof settles for obvious punchlines, delivering just enough laughs to justify its existence without coming anywhere near the bar set by ""Scary Movie."" "
437,Dance Flick,3.5,30,New York Daily News," There's an art to making a good spoof, but good luck finding it in Dance Flick, not only because the movie goes for easy toilet humor, but because it often relies on it to stay afloat. "
438,Dance Flick,3.5,25,Boston Globe," If you thought the world couldn't get enough of bad spoof movies, you thought wrong. "
439,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,67,Austin Chronicle," Far more coherent than its immediate predecessor, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D benefits greatly from its two likable young leads and some of the series' wittiest, pun-filled writing. "
440,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,60,Boxoffice Magazine," Far more charming, quick-witted and high spirited than anyone could have expected...for a film that didn't screen for press. It's gimmicky up the wazoo (not just 3D, but scratch-and-sniff ""Aroma-Scope"" cards handed out at screenings) and it's all the better for it. "
441,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,50,Movieline," The film is being released in both 2- and 3-D, and from what I could tell the 3-D version is still almost 50-50. What use is made of the technology is hardly worth the effort, unless you've always wanted to experience a cascade of cheesies in 3-D. "
442,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,50,Chicago Reader," The visual effects are as gleefully shoddy as ever, and the playful ideas sometimes achieve a dreamlike suggestiveness. "
443,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38,Orlando Sentinel, Nobody has much that's funny to say or cool to do. Even the spy gadgets are lame. 
444,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38,Boston Globe," Alba, meanwhile, is again ridiculously shoehorned into a comedy gig, although she does have an amusing opening bit spying while nine months pregnant. If only diaper bomb gags weren't the inevitable follow-up. "
445,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,33,The A.V. Club," The Spy Kids series once seemed charmingly homemade. These days, it feels less charmingly homemade than maddeningly amateurish. "
446,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Arriving eight years after the lame third installment in Dimension's profitable series, this seems like far too little way too late. "
447,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,30,Variety," A cheap-looking, vaguely depressing echo of Robert Rodriguez's well-loved kidpic trilogy, assembled with minimal imagination or effort. "
448,Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,30,The New York Times," The fall-off in sexiness, soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas, the parents in the first three ""Spy Kids"" films, to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep. "
449,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,60,Los Angeles Times," ""Black” foregoes too much scene-setting, chronology and logic to stand completely on its own. As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in “Grey” and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original’s numerous plot holes. "
450,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,58,Entertainment Weekly, The film manages to be surprisingly subversive with its humor. 
451,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,42,The A.V. Club, When Wayans allows himself to deviate from his formula there are a few effective moments of un-self-conscious slapstick. 
452,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,40,The New York Times," As with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull’s-eyes arrive only intermittently. "
453,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,38,Slant Magazine," An aimless, if sporadically clever, parody that tirelessly conceives of human sexuality as punchlines for its shortsighted cultural ribbings. "
454,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,38,RogerEbert.com," Mostly, Fifty Shades of Black is exactly what you expect it will be. It hits all the notes of its source material, only it amps them up, and it seems to get the inherent absurdity of this premise even more than Sam Taylor-Johnson’s movie did. "
455,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,33,Consequence of Sound," Marlon Wayans is clearly getting off on the gags, but the lazy, hard humor, and elastic joke-making eventually has a numbing effect. "
456,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,30,Variety," At a minimum, a parody should be funnier than the film it’s sending up, but Fifty Shades of Black, a quick-and-dirty riff on last year’s S&M romance “Fifty Shades of Grey,” falls a laugh or two short of even that low standard. "
457,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,20,The Hollywood Reporter," The funniest bit involves a particularly sadistic brand of torture that he inflicts on Hannah.... She quite rightly screams in protest, as should anyone forced to watch this movie. "
458,Fifty Shades of Black,3.5,0,TheWrap, A slapdash movie that’s more unbearable than the heavy-breathing best-seller and its emotionally timid screen adaptation. 
459,Jaws 3-D,3.6,50,The New York Times," It's harmless but unsurprising...Without Steven Spielberg's timing or John Williams's music, the shark's periodic visits become feeding scenes rather than ferocious attacks. It's like watching someone make regular raids on a refrigerator in search of midnight snacks. "
460,Jaws 3-D,3.6,50,Miami Herald," Yes, it's all pretty silly. But for those who can stand the annoyance of the cardboard glasses, there are worse ways to kill a hot afternoon. [23 July 1983, p.D6] "
461,Jaws 3-D,3.6,40,TV Guide Magazine," Although shot well and boasting some effective 3-D work, this is a woefully inadequate effort, and the series began to slip into inadvertent self-parody. "
462,Jaws 3-D,3.6,30,Variety, The Jaws cycle has reached its nadir with this surprisingly tepid [Arrivision] 3-D version. 
463,Jaws 3-D,3.6,30,Washington Post," Jaws 3-D makes a conclusive case for terminating further sequels to ""Jaws,"" as if one were needed. It also reinforces the impression that 3-D is unlikely to make a sustained comeback until its optical inconveniences and dependence on hokey scare effects can be overcome. [23 July 1983, p.C1] "
464,Jaws 3-D,3.6,30,Newsweek," One can safely doze through the extremely bland first hour, which feels more like an advertisement for marine theme parks than a suspense movie. [1 Aug 1983, p.47] "
465,Jaws 3-D,3.6,20,Empire," A toothless, tedious farce which deserves to sink without a trace. "
466,Jaws 3-D,3.6,20,Time Out London, A right royal turkey. 
467,Jaws 3-D,3.6,20,Washington Post," Jaws 3-D, in which the Amity horror swims south to Florida, looks a lot like a Poligrip commercial, what with its extreme close-ups of the Great White's artificial chompers. [29 July 1983, p.17] "
468,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,50,The New York Times, What results is a candy-colored broad comedy with noteworthy performances. 
469,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,50,Portland Oregonian," Cute and funny, with plenty of slapstick and cuddly creatures for the kids and enough adult wit to keep parents reasonably amused. "
470,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,50,Los Angeles Times," It feels more like a cartoon, and when you're dealing with modern Stone Age families, that can only be a plus. "
471,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,30,Film.com," This movie is a business decision, and about as diverting to watch as someone reading the Universal fiscal report. "
472,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,30,Washington Post," It's zany. Actually, it's so zany it's almost creepy. "
473,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,25,Baltimore Sun," A tired piece of hackery, made only slightly less distasteful by a couple of inspired moments from supporting player Alan Cumming. "
474,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,20,TNT RoughCut," A bumpy synthesis of special and visual effects done far too over the top ultimately means Viva Rock Vegas is nothing more than eye candy, and not a very tasty piece at that. "
475,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,20,Film.com, A Dum-Dum Movie 
476,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,20,L.A. Weekly, Everything from the Rube Goldberg sets to the Jim Henson creatures is aimed squarely at a preschool audience. 
477,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,3.6,0,Austin Chronicle, Even the youngest members of the audience appeared to be more interested in their dwindling soda supply than anything up on the screen. Yabba dabba doom. 
478,Swept Away,3.6,40,Variety, A simple misfire rather than a world-class fiasco. This misguided attempt to remake Lina Wertmuller's corrosive 1974 satire as a wistful romance is only unintentionally funny in the last reel. 
479,Swept Away,3.6,38,Chicago Tribune," One hopes that this is Hollywood's last go-round with Swept Away. Watching this fiasco, I kept having nightmares about a possible cartoon version, co-starring Cruella de Vil and Shrek. "
480,Swept Away,3.6,30,Los Angeles Times," Madonna may be better in this film than she's been in some of her recent endeavors, especially when she stops screeching her lines, but she's done herself no favors with her choice of material. "
481,Swept Away,3.6,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," No less laughable is the ending, where Ritchie neatly reflects today's prevailing attitude -- that audiences can't be trusted to handle a hint of ambiguity, but can live happily with flat-out stupidity. "
482,Swept Away,3.6,25,Chicago Sun-Times," A deserted island movie during which I desperately wished the characters had chosen one movie to take along if they were stranded on a deserted island, and were showing it to us instead of this one. "
483,Swept Away,3.6,20,Village Voice," Merely an indulgent vehicle for Mrs. Ritchie -- and Madonna is so spectacularly convincing as a hateful, self-absorbed, nouveau riche ogress that her character's third-act transformation is as preposterous as her overmuscled physique. "
484,Swept Away,3.6,20,Washington Post, At no point should anyone mistake this for an actual movie. This is an extended beach video that will leave no one swept away. 
485,Swept Away,3.6,20,The New York Times," There is no credible feeling here, no comedy, no eroticism. "
486,Swept Away,3.6,10,Salon," Isn't dubbed. But it sure feels like it. The characters open their mouths and their lips don't seem to be shaping the right words -- you can't believe any human beings would ever utter such ludicrous dialogue, with so little conviction. "
487,Swept Away,3.6,10,Washington Post," The film turns out to have nothing going for it at all, except a small charge for soul-deep Madonna haters. "
488,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,30,TV Guide Magazine," The tiny, impassive-faced Liu is a disaster. She looks cute in her custom commando gear, but she's not actress enough to make Sever's ridiculous, faux hard-boiled dialogue sound like anything but the formulaic nonsense it is. "
489,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,25,Miami Herald, Sometimes it seems as though Hollywood can't make a decent action movie anymore. Now that's a thought to make you go ballistic. 
490,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,25,New York Daily News," To pay for all the explosions and stunt work, the filmmakers must have decided to skimp on the screenplay. The rule of thumb is that one page of script equals one minute of movie, but there is so little dialogue in Ballistic that it could have been written on a matchbook. "
491,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,25,Baltimore Sun, The collateral damage of action products like Ballistic is to the sensibility of the audience. 
492,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,20,Variety," Remote, non-involving and finally incomprehensible. "
493,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,20,The A.V. Club," Looks like a video-game promo, has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show, and feels like a headache waiting to happen. "
494,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,12,Boston Globe," Banderas slums through this dollar-bin action flick wearing the same look of wiped-out exasperation that Danny Glover's Sergeant Murtaugh sports in each installment of ''Lethal Weapon.'' And like Murtaugh, Banderas might be too old for this, too. "
495,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,10,Washington Post," You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense. --It's almost completely uninvolving, as well as being impenetrable. "
496,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,10,The New York Times," The film isn't even as good as the second-rate game it is based on, which is nothing but a shootout. "
497,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,3.6,0,San Francisco Chronicle, Movies don't get much worse. 
498,You Got Served,3.6,60,Dallas Observer," Director Christopher B. Stokes (House Party 4) shapes up the fabulous dance sequences with undeniable energy, and real-life brothers Houston and Grandberry are two of the most enjoyable musicians to appear onscreen since Sting played a bellboy. "
499,You Got Served,3.6,50,Boston Globe," Part soap opera and part thriller, and it has the unique characteristic of being both undeveloped and overwritten. "
500,You Got Served,3.6,40,L.A. Weekly," Seems stuck in fad mode, a showcase in search of a movie. "
501,You Got Served,3.6,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Assembling this vehicle for his young clients, music producer/manager/video director Christopher B. Stokes has attached an anemic plot to a series of dynamic hip-hop dance sequences. "
502,You Got Served,3.6,40,Variety," A serviceable youth pic that's marginally less dumb than November's urban quasi-musical ""Honey."" "
503,You Got Served,3.6,40,The New York Times," Will probably keep its core audience of suburban teenagers mildly entertained for the course of its 93 minutes. Urban grumps, however, may be distracted by Mr. Stokes's annoyingly overedited execution of the dance sequences. "
504,You Got Served,3.6,38,Baltimore Sun, The astonishing brio and verve of street dancing deserves better than this. 
505,You Got Served,3.6,25,New York Daily News, This amateurish drama about street-dance contests and busted friendship is about as real as Lil' Kim's chest. 
506,You Got Served,3.6,25,New York Post," Cliched, amateurish and feeble. "
507,You Got Served,3.6,25,Philadelphia Inquirer, Rarely do you encounter a movie without a shred of originality. You Got Served is such a cinematic vacuum. 
508,D-War,3.6,63,TV Guide Magazine," Frankly, it's dumb, but no dumber than ""Transformers."" "
509,D-War,3.6,50,Variety," A feast of A-grade f/x married to a Z-grade, irony-free script. "
510,D-War,3.6,50,The New York Times," It is such a breathless, delirious stew, it’s impossible not to be entertained, provided -- this is crucial -- you have a sense of humor. "
511,D-War,3.6,40,The Hollywood Reporter," While the CGI effects are undeniably impressive, the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor (most of it involving a hapless zoo security guard) seriously detract from the fun. "
512,D-War,3.6,38,Boston Globe," You don't have to hand the folks behind Dragon Wars much (the acting, directing, costumes, editing, props, music, etc: They're all off). But when they decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown Los Angeles, the movie turns shockingly watchable. "
513,D-War,3.6,30,L.A. Weekly, This one’s for connoisseurs of the “totally preposterous crap” school of fantasy cinema. 
514,D-War,3.6,30,Los Angeles Times, Fluent in the laughable dialogue of a million bad fantasy flicks: 
515,D-War,3.6,30,Austin Chronicle, This South Korean pseudo-epic is some of the most ambitious cr-- I've ever seen. 
516,D-War,3.6,16,The A.V. Club," All the thought seems to have gone into the marketing, and none into the unfathomably terrible script. "
517,The Fog,3.6,50,Boston Globe," This new Fog floats in on the fumes of the 1980 John Carpenter original, but the surprise is that it's arguably better. "
518,The Fog,3.6,50,The A.V. Club," It's virtually indiscernible from any other contemporary horror film except for, well, the fog. "
519,The Fog,3.6,40,The New York Times," Mildly scary here and there. It does not play by all the horror movie rules (e.g., the black guy always dies first). And the cast is good-looking. "
520,The Fog,3.6,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Director Rupert Wainwright fails to bring any style to the material, not producing a fraction of the suspense or wit generated by Carpenter in the original even while working with a far lesser budget. "
521,The Fog,3.6,40,Variety," Unfortunately, interest lags between the grisly deaths, and, worse, none of the characters generates rooting interest. "
522,The Fog,3.6,38,TV Guide Magazine," If the characters were more interesting, the long, long buildup to their night of ghostly reckoning might be suspenseful rather than tedious. "
523,The Fog,3.6,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Most of The Fog will seem drearily perfunctory even to those viewers who don't know Carpenter's version, which itself emulated the elegant gloom of Val Lewton's horror pics of the 1940s. "
524,The Fog,3.6,25,New York Daily News," The fog also does something genuinely eerie: It causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned, burned, stabbed or thrown into glass display cases. "
525,The Fog,3.6,25,New York Post," I was held in suspense throughout The Fog, aching to learn the answer to its central riddle: Why would any one remake such a crummy movie? "
526,The Fog,3.6,10,Film Threat," It's too mediocre (and PG-13) to be classified as a horror film, too inane to be taken seriously and too uninteresting to be bothered with. "
527,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,60,L.A. Weekly," In short, it’s a gift-wrapped part for Lohan, who plays her good-girl/bad-girl role with wit and an air of sly calculation. "
528,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,50,Boston Globe, An intensely unpleasant killer-thriller mystery. 
529,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,38,TV Guide Magazine," The most shocking thing about this ludicrous serial-killer shocker, released the week troubled 21-year-old former child star Lindsay Lohan was arrested on DUI and cocaine-possession charges, is that it's the kind of film actresses generally make when their careers are well and truly on the skids. "
530,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,38,Chicago Tribune," The film suggests Lohan probably (allegedly) should've gone after her agent the other night, not the mother of an ex-personal assistant. "
531,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,30,Variety," Much like the ongoing real-world meltdown of its troubled star, Lindsay Lohan, I Know Who Killed Me is a disaster that exerts a perverse fascination. "
532,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,25,ReelViews," Unless you derive pleasure from watching Lohan being tortured, there's no reason to subject yourself to this movie. Besides, if that's your goal, all you have to do is turn on tabloid TV. There's Lindsay's living hell of a life, being broadcast 24/7. "
533,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,16,The A.V. Club," Having broken free of the Disney machine that molded her, Lohan now seems intent on destroying her career and credibility on her own terms. "
534,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,0,The Hollywood Reporter, There's a fresh candidate in the running for worst movie of 2007 honors. 
535,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,0,New York Post," Sony dumped this sleazy, inept and worthless piece of torture porn into theaters yesterday. "
536,I Know Who Killed Me,3.6,0,Premiere," I can’t say I was too surprised by how risible, grotesque, and incoherent I Know Who Killed Me is. But I can’t say I was prepared for its pretentiousness. If the picture has any use at all, it’s as a case study in what happens when the talentless attempt to emulate the inspired. "
537,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,60,The New York Times," Threadbare as it's beginning to look, the Superman series hasn't lost its raison d'etre. There's life in the old boy yet. "
538,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,60,Tampa Bay Times," Superman IV: The Quest for Peace doesn't attempt to disguise its sentiments - no more so than Greenpeace - but neither does it lose the campy spirit of the 1978 original. Although never as stylish as the first movie, it shows verve and a modest wit. Superman IV is not as funny as the first sequel, but it isn't as violent, either. [27 July 1987, p.1D] "
539,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,38,Miami Herald," Superman IV works rather well as a children's movie. It even has a line or two for adults -- though not, one hastens to qualify, enough to actually warrant adult attendance. [25 July 1987, p.B1] "
540,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,25,Chicago Tribune," Superman IV is a pathetic appendage to the series, a dull, shoddy film that makes the minimal 1950s TV series seem rife with production values by comparison. [27 July 1987, p.10C] "
541,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,20,Variety," The earlier films in the series were far from perfect, but at their best they had some flair and agreeable humor, qualities this one sorely lacks. Hackman gets a few laughs, but has less to work with than before, and everyone else seems to be just going through the motions and having less fun doing so. "
542,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,20,Empire, Predictably awful fourth installment. 
543,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,20,Chicago Reader," By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour. "
544,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,20,Washington Post," Superman IV, except for a glitzy new villain named Nuclear Man, is one of the cheesiest movies ever made. It's so grainy and grossly envisioned, it seems filmed on pulp. Superman's crystalline Arctic palace looks as if it's made of no-deposit-no-return soda bottles, and his suit of primary colors has ring around the collar. "
545,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,12,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," This one is a big, big disappointment. [27 July 1987] "
546,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,10,Los Angeles Times," Sequels to big-budget popular hits usually end up super-slick, shallow and inflated. But this one isn't even super-slick; it's shallow and deflated...The overall effect is of a story atomized and dying before our eyes, collapsing into smashed pulp, ground down into big-budget Kryptonite ash. [27 July 1987, p.1] "
547,Caddyshack II,3.7,25,Chicago Tribune," It`s shoddy, lazy and numbingly stupid. "
548,Caddyshack II,3.7,25,Miami Herald," Beyond the anemic script, though, Caddyshack II fails because Dangerfield fits the character better. His bulging eyes and neurotic demeanor fuel his lethal jabs. Even though he's still the stand-up comic, his well-established routine makes it easier to believe him. [27 July 1988, p.D1] "
549,Caddyshack II,3.7,20,TV Guide Magazine," A disaster. Mason founders in his poorly written role, and none of the film's endless series of gags is the least bit funny. "
550,Caddyshack II,3.7,10,Washington Post," Caddyshack II, a feeble follow-up to the 1980 laff riot, is lamer than a duck with bunions, and dumber than grubs. It's patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet. "
551,Caddyshack II,3.7,10,The New York Times," The film features someone who walks like Jackie Mason, talks like Jackie Mason, does everything except make people laugh like Jackie Mason. "
552,Caddyshack II,3.7,10,Orlando Sentinel," This PG-rated romp is bland bananas compared to its R-rated predecessor. Besides, immediately following the liberating craziness of Animal House, another slob comedy didn't seem like such a bad idea. Now, after nearly a decade of slob comedies, the last thing we need is yet another, tamer one. "
553,Caddyshack II,3.7,0,Los Angeles Times," This movie is soooo bad (How bad is it?) that it makes ""Caddyshack I"" look like ""Godfather II."" "
554,The Avengers,3.7,40,Newsweek," This is an elaborate production, but all the jazzy sets and explosions in the world can't disguise the story's complete lack of urgency. "
555,The Avengers,3.7,30,Austin Chronicle," This new film version, sad to say, is a hollow shell of the original series. "
556,The Avengers,3.7,25,ReelViews, This film is an absolute mess. 
557,The Avengers,3.7,20,Los Angeles Times, So how then do you duplicate a magic aura from 30 years ago? You don't. 
558,The Avengers,3.7,20,Chicago Reader," The grasping novelty of the visuals doesn't rival the uncharismatic leads or the hopelessly, unironically banal plot. "
559,The Avengers,3.7,10,L.A. Weekly, It's shockingly inert. 
560,The Avengers,3.7,10,Salon," The film flails incoherently from set to set, trying to be kicky and madcap and pop, but with no sense of the show's casual acceptance of the absurd. "
561,The Avengers,3.7,10,The New York Times, It's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. 
562,The Avengers,3.7,0,The A.V. Club, It's almost fascinating to witness just how lousy The Avengers really is. 
563,The Avengers,3.7,0,San Francisco Chronicle," It's a completely botched effort -- botched in its direction, its writing and editing. "
564,Batman & Robin,3.7,70,The New York Times," Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible. "
565,Batman & Robin,3.7,60,Salon," There's something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing, capable acting or inspired directing. "
566,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,Chicago Sun-Times," Batman & Robin, like the first three films in the series, is wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core. "
567,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,ReelViews," This film, which places yet another actor in the batsuit, has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue. "
568,Batman & Robin,3.7,50,San Francisco Chronicle," It's the lightest of the Batman movies, the most cartoony, the dumbest and the least ambitious. But it holds the audience's attention, brings on a few laughs and never really gets boring. "
569,Batman & Robin,3.7,40,L.A. Weekly," There's so much happening in the movie that it feels like nothing is happening at all. Which leaves you free to gaze, slack-jawed, on the true glory of Batman & Robin -- its fabulously color-coded set design. "
570,Batman & Robin,3.7,25,San Francisco Examiner, Clooney's stiff cornball delivery and tendency to smile during the most tragic moments bring this as close to the cartoonish Batman television series of the 1960s as any of the movies have come. 
571,Batman & Robin,3.7,20,Austin Chronicle," Batman & Robin fails to engage the spirit of Batman, Robin, or decent marketing in general, and instead ends up as a limp, excruciatingly shallow knockoff that leaves viewers cringing at the unavoidable one-liners that make up the better part of the script. "
572,Batman & Robin,3.7,10,The A.V. Club," Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman, but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics, he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse, backwards. "
573,Batman & Robin,3.7,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward. "
574,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,60,Chicago Reader," But the most stimulating, satisfying aspect of this action fantasy is the theme music. "
575,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved. "
576,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,20,Empire, It would miss the point to complain that the plot is nonsensical drivel peopled by paper-thin characters and a paucity of ideas. 
577,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,20,TV Guide Magazine," This tedious hodgepodge of martial-arts mayhem, bogus mysticism and computer-generated special effects doesn't even pretend to have a plot. "
578,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,16,Entertainment Weekly," Fragmented and monotonous, without a semblance of the gymnastic cleverness that at least made the first Mortal Kombat film into watchable trash, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is as debased as movies come. "
579,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,12,ReelViews," This film has no story, no characters, and no coherence. "
580,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,10,The New York Times, Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull. 
581,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,10,Los Angeles Times," The sequel is quite serious, charmless and critic-proof (in fact, it wasn't screened for the media), and it may attract the teenagers who have made the game so popular. [24Nov1997 Pg.10] "
582,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,0,Austin Chronicle, The movie is nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed (by returning star Robin Shou) fight sequences that mix live-action foregrounds with complexly layered digital effects and are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements. 
583,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,3.7,0,L.A. Weekly," It's cynical and it's depressing, and I would lock a child in a room before I'd show him Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. "
584,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,50,New York Daily News," The special effects work fine for minor acts of magic, but the climactic aerial dragon fight is lame, and most of the performances are at the level of high school plays. "
585,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," Much of the dialogue is the silliest sort of fantasy mush, and a good deal of the picture appears to have been shot while the lighting guys were out to lunch. "
586,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,50,Boston Globe, A mildly entertaining but tepid extravaganza more suited to television than the big screen. 
587,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,25,San Francisco Chronicle," The audience has already checked out, long before the formulaic finish. "
588,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,20,Film.com," Good intentions, bad writing. "
589,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,10,L.A. Weekly," A cheap ""Star Wars"" rip-off with swords instead of light sabers. "
590,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,10,Salon," This fantasy crap, fake-o effects and all, betrays princes of dice, masters of graph and wielders of bong. "
591,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,10,The New York Times, Take this as a warning: it's not much fun. 
592,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,0,Village Voice, At once laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible. 
593,Dungeons & Dragons,3.7,0,New York Post," Tacky-looking, incoherent, badly acted and hopelessly directed disaster is easily the dullest adventure film of 2000. "
594,The Room,3.7,30,Chicago Reader," This inept 2003 melodrama has become a Rocky Horror-style cult favorite...As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality. "
595,The Room,3.7,25,Portland Oregonian," Tommy Wiseau's film oozes sincerity, which is then slathered in a thick coating of oblivious narcissism, and sadly serves as an example that not everyone should follow their bliss...It's the emotional earnestness that places The Room squarely within Susan Sontag's famous definition of pure camp. "
596,The Room,3.7,12,Chicago Sun-Times," You can laugh at lines like: ""Hey, everybody, let's go inside and eat some cake""; ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!""; ""Man, I just can't figure women out. Sometimes they're just too smart. Sometimes they're flat out stupid. Other times they're just evil."" In Wiseau's worldview, if ""The Room"" were a woman, she wouldn't be ""evil"" or ""too smart."" That leaves ""flat-out stupid."" [12 Feb 2012, p.B2] "
597,The Room,3.7,10,Variety," The Room marks the writing-directing-acting debut of Tommy Wiseau, who's not just one of the most unusual looking and sounding (with an unidentifiable Eastern European accent) leading men ever to grace the screen, but a narcissist nonpareil whose movie makes Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" seem the apotheosis of cinematic self-restraint. "
598,The Room,3.7,0,Movie Nation," That’s the trick to making a cult film. It can’t just be bad, it has to be memorably so, and The Room is. "
599,The Wicker Man,3.7,75,New York Post," Profoundly disturbing, blood-chilling suspenser. "
600,The Wicker Man,3.7,50,Los Angeles Times," In the end, LaBute's remake is an interesting idea that never transforms into a particularly satisfying movie. "
601,The Wicker Man,3.7,40,Film Threat, The Wicker Man isn't all that bad a movie; it's visually striking and ambitious in some ways. It just fails to bring enough to the table to fully distance itself from the original. 
602,The Wicker Man,3.7,40,L.A. Weekly," This wasn't a horror film the first time around, and LaBute makes sorry feints at effective creepiness, letting the story roam in circles just like Cage. "
603,The Wicker Man,3.7,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Unlikely to inspire a passionate following similar to the original, the film, which opened Friday without being screened for the press, ultimately induces more titters than dread. "
604,The Wicker Man,3.7,40,Variety, Any provocative questions LaBute might have wanted to raise are totally obscured as the rising tide of absurdity gradually overwhelms the entire enterprise. 
605,The Wicker Man,3.7,38,TV Guide Magazine," There may be a way to remake 1973's cult thriller The Wicker Man, in which a deeply Christian cop has his religious convictions shaken to the core as he investigates the disappearance of a child from within a cheerfully pagan community, but Neil LaBute didn't find it. "
606,The Wicker Man,3.7,38,New York Daily News," As an allegory of religious conflict, the '73 film is brilliantly constructed and ends with a punctuation mark that was shocking in its day. LaBute's movie attempts to shock, as well, and does: Given the names involved and the casting of Cage, it is shockingly bad. "
607,The Wicker Man,3.7,33,The A.V. Club, Turns a cultishly creepy classic into a dull and windy farce. 
608,The Wicker Man,3.7,30,The New York Times," A movie like this can survive an absurd premise but not incompetent execution. And Mr. LaBute, never much of an artist with the camera, proves almost comically inept as a horror-movie technician...It's neither haunting nor amusing; just boring. "
609,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,60,Variety," Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick. "
610,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,60,The New York Times," Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle’s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam’s action choreography unusually witty. "
611,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (""Romeo Must Die"") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit. "
612,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,25,TV Guide Magazine," There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it. "
613,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,25,Boston Globe," This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us. "
614,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,20,L.A. Weekly, Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment. 
615,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,20,Los Angeles Times," Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown. "
616,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,16,Entertainment Weekly, Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad. 
617,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,0,The A.V. Club," The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk. "
618,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,0,Austin Chronicle, It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is. 
619,Piranha 3DD,3.7,60,Variety," Ups the self-parody so much that it's practically a Wayans Brothers spoof, albeit with fewer jokes. "
620,Piranha 3DD,3.7,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Piranha 3DD is overcrowded and pointlessly mean. The stunt casting of David Hasselhoff playing himself, riffing off his infamous 2007 drunken home video, gets in the way of the storyline. "
621,Piranha 3DD,3.7,40,Total Film," ""Welcome to rock bottom!"" sighs Hasselhoff at one stage, pretty much summing up this textbook exercise in sloppy seconds. Here's hoping the piranhas have a better agent than he does. "
622,Piranha 3DD,3.7,40,Boxoffice Magazine," It seems impossible that a sequel to a movie as ridiculous as ""Piranha 3D"" could disappoint but Piranha 3DD stops at mediocre before arriving at gloriously bad. "
623,Piranha 3DD,3.7,30,Village Voice," Add to this that it takes place in the town of Merkin, and you'll get an idea of the labored spirit of dirty-old-man humor that prevails. "
624,Piranha 3DD,3.7,25,Slant Magazine," John Gulager is neither artist nor genius, bringing only straight-to-video conviction to Piranha 3DD. "
625,Piranha 3DD,3.7,25,Movieline," ""Piranha 3D"" was ridiculous, gory and fun, everything Piranha 3DD is not. "
626,Piranha 3DD,3.7,20,Time Out, Hecklers can take the night off; ripping on a movie this bad is as rewarding as shooting fish in a barrel. 
627,Piranha 3DD,3.7,20,The New York Times," The director, John Gulager, has no idea how to mix his ingredients to create a savvy self-parody. "
628,Piranha 3DD,3.7,11,Austin Chronicle," Disappointingly, Piranha 3DD, the inevitable sequel to the remake, has none of Dante's wit, Aja's directorial skills, or Greg Nicotero's grotesqueries. "
629,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,60,Chicago Reader," Boorman deserves credit for trying out some new ideas, even if most of them backfire. Visually, it's fascinating—sort of a blend of Minnellian baroque and Buñuelian absurdity—but the dialogue is childish, the story is incomprehensible, and the metaphysics are ridiculous. Still, an audacious failure is preferable to a chickenhearted success. More than worth a look, if only out of curiosity. "
630,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,50,Variety," Since any title containing Roman numerals invites comparison, the answer is: No, Exorcist II is not as good as The Exorcist. It isn't even close. Gone now is the simple clash between Good and Evil, replaced by some goofy transcendental spiritualism. "
631,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,50,Time Out," Substantially recut by Boorman after his original version was derided in America, but it's still easy to see why New Yorkers jeered. Boorman completely avoids gore and obscenity, treating the original as a kind of sacred good-versus-evil text, and weaving its sets and characters into a highly traditional confrontation of occult forces. "
632,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,50,TV Guide Magazine," Not as awful as its notorious reputation would indicate, but certainly not the neglected masterpiece its small cult of supporters has claimed, Boorman's gorgeously shot sequel to The Exorcist has isolated moments of breathtaking imagery, but its parts do not add up to a satisfying whole. "
633,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,50,The New Yorker," The film is too cadenced and exotic and too deliriously complicated to succeed with most audiences (and when it opened, there were accounts of people in theaters who threw things at the screen). But it's winged camp--a horror fairy tale gone wild, another in the long history of moviemakers' king-size follies. There's enough visual magic in it for a dozen good movies; what it lacks is judgement. "
634,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,42,The A.V. Club, It would be a lot easier to buy Exorcist II: The Heretic as a mood piece if it was able to sustain a tone beyond clumsy exposition and hysterical camp for longer than a few minutes. 
635,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,40,Empire, A famously disastrous follow-up to William Friedkin’s horror hit. 
636,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,40,Rolling Stone, A snooze-fest without any scares. 
637,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,40,Newsweek," This sequel is so laden with dubious, spurious, curious and tedious stuff about theology, parapsychology, entomology and speleology that it forgets to frighten you in its frantic concern with being hip in the fad world of the occult. The Heretic simply drowns in its own malarky. [27 June 1977, p.61] "
638,Exorcist II: The Heretic,3.8,30,The New York Times, Exorcist II begins by looking foolish and slowly becomes a straightfaced film of the absurd. 
639,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,88,Chicago Sun-Times, Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure. 
640,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,50,The New York Times," Despite huge resources at Mr. De Bont's disposal and the fact that both he and Ms. Bullock have achieved stellar status since ''Speed'' screeched onto movie screens, the sequel is still a B-movie at heart. "
641,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,40,Austin Chronicle," Not nearly as clever at taxing the audience's knuckles as its forerunner, Speed 2 still manages to stay above board long enough to merit a look-see, if only to relish the once-in-a-lifetime pleasure of Mr. Dafoe and his pet leeches. "
642,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,38,ReelViews, Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made. 
643,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,25,San Francisco Examiner, This is my idea of a nightmare. 
644,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," And De Bont's effects are wildly over the top, devoid of the stylish cuts and intriguing angles that enriched the original. In fact, there's so little panache in his destructive action that it begins to seem like a weird act of self-destruction. "
645,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,10,Washington Post," The 1994 ""Speed,"" which starred Bullock and Keanu Reeves, was hardly ""King Lear"" on a bus, but it was an entertaining ride. But this movie is nothing but pain to sit through. "
646,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,0,Salon, Speed 2 is such an inept piece of direction that it's anybody's guess whether De Bont understands how to convey where two characters are in spatial relation to each other or in relation to the action. 
647,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,0,San Francisco Chronicle," This may be hard to believe, but there's not a single moment of drama or tension in any of the action sequences. And the film is made up almost entirely of action. "
648,Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,0,Washington Post," The kinetics aren't that good, the twaddle is off the charts and the characters seem written by monkeys on amphetamines with crayons. "
649,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,38,New York Daily News," Eddie Murphy's latest comedy, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, takes place in the year 2087, which is about the earliest he can hope to be forgiven. "
650,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,30,TV Guide Magazine," There are worse movies, but that's no excuse. Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment. "
651,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of. 
652,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,20,New Times (L.A.)," Only Quaid, as a semiretarded horny robot, and Cleese as a fussy chauffeur hologram seem to get it. Even Murphy, as the titular nightclub big shot in outer space, forgets to be actually funny until the climax. "
653,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,20,Austin Chronicle, In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused. 
654,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,20,Variety, The proper mix is never found. Ill-conceived and expensive project that winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it. 
655,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,20,Los Angeles Times," It's not awful, but the high cost of a movie ticket these days seems like a steep price to pay for 90 minutes of air conditioning and production design. "
656,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,10,L.A. Weekly, Murphy slogs his way through this dismally dull sci-fi comedy. 
657,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,10,The A.V. Club, A headache-inducing mess without direction or purpose. 
658,The Adventures of Pluto Nash,3.8,0,New York Post, So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines. 
659,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,50,ReelViews," A second-rate regurgitation of ""The Lord of the Rings."" Everything about it, down to the set and costume design, apes Peter Jackson's epic trilogy. However, while ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a grand story of scope and power, In the Name of the King feels small in more ways than one. "
660,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,30,Los Angeles Times," Its convictionless competence is merely dull, denying the pleasures of an outright howler without providing much else. "
661,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), Is this movie so god-awful bad that it's hilariously good? Can't be bothered deciding. Figure that's an answer in itself. 
662,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,25,Boston Globe," This is the sort of movie where men stand blankly over dead loved ones, then start digging. Masculine stoicism or emotional botox? You decide. "
663,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,25,The A.V. Club, Cultists will be happy to discover that In The Name Of The King bears all the so-bad-it's-good hallmarks of a classic Boll production. 
664,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,25,TV Guide Magazine," Director Uwe Boll sticks with what he knows -- how to turn video games into dull, cheap-looking movies. "
665,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,20,The New York Times," An awkward “Lord of the Rings” knockoff, it features both elaborate battles and bumbling humor, though it’s never quite clear when you should be laughing. "
666,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,11,Austin Chronicle," Who among us can explain the enigma wrapped in a riddle surrounded by fierce, ravening, razor-toothed conundrums that is German director Uwe Boll? "
667,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,10,The Hollywood Reporter," It's completely undone by its terrible screenplay, inept direction, oppressive musical score and muddy visual palette. "
668,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,3.8,10,Variety," A plodding patchwork of derivative fantasy-adventure, medieval production design, risible dialogue, unimpressive CGI trickery and haphazardly edited action sequences. "
669,Furry Vengeance,3.8,50,Entertainment Weekly," Still, it's refreshing that the animals don't talk. "
670,Furry Vengeance,3.8,42,The A.V. Club," While Fraser’s presence doesn’t necessarily elevate Furry Vengeance into something better than the dumb, lowbrow timewaster it aspires to be, Fraser does make it a little easier to digest. "
671,Furry Vengeance,3.8,38,Orlando Sentinel," On the sliding critter-comedy scale, Furry Vengeance falls somewhere between the Chipmunks and the Chihuahua (the one from Beverly Hills). "
672,Furry Vengeance,3.8,38,St. Louis Post-Dispatch," The message that needs to be posted at the theater door is ""No trespassing."" "
673,Furry Vengeance,3.8,30,Village Voice, Furry Vengeance isn’t really a movie at all; it's a message provided by the good people at Participant Media. 
674,Furry Vengeance,3.8,25,USA Today," Furry Vengeance is a slapstick stinker, easily the worst movie of the year. "
675,Furry Vengeance,3.8,20,Arizona Republic," Maybe your kids will insist that you see Furry Vengeance. Then again, wouldn't this be the perfect time to let them test their independence and sit through it alone? Otherwise, good luck. You have my condolences. "
676,Furry Vengeance,3.8,20,Boxoffice Magazine, The movie's simple-minded lesson that forests are good and development is bad is undercut the minute one pauses to think about how many natural resources were wasted on this sorry excuse for a motion picture. 
677,Furry Vengeance,3.8,12,Boston Globe," Vengeance has the odor of court-ordered community service. The jokes never rise above the groin. The trees look plastic, the characters more so. "
678,Furry Vengeance,3.8,0,The New York Times, Furry Vengeance is unbearable. 
679,The Love Guru,3.8,42,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," If you're a Toronto native or a big-time hockey geek, there are enough little in jokes to probably carry you through the leaden pacing and barrel-scraping gross-out humor, but it's an awfully dull ride for the rest of us. "
680,The Love Guru,3.8,40,Variety," So relentlessly juvenile as to merit a new twist on the PG-13 rating -- one that strongly cautions not only those under 13 but anyone much above it, too. "
681,The Love Guru,3.8,38,Chicago Tribune," The Love Guru”does not bring out Myer's best, and aside from a deft early Bollywood parody, there’s nothing visually to help the fun along. "
682,The Love Guru,3.8,33,The A.V. Club," Myers combines his love of references, silly names, and mindless repetition by having his guru use ""Mariska Hargitay"" as a greeting/mantra. The first time it's employed, it's merely unfunny; by the 13th or 40th time, it's almost hypnotic in its awfulness. "
683,The Love Guru,3.8,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Not only does the film stumble badly from one skit to another, the skits themselves have too much dead air. "
684,The Love Guru,3.8,30,Village Voice," Now and again some pungent writing leaks through to poke fun at the excruciating banality of guru wisdom. But mostly it’s dreary dick jokes and elephant poop, slack directing by Marco Schnabel, and, of all fatal errors, Mike Myers, shooting for cuddly. "
685,The Love Guru,3.8,30,Washington Post," The results are a wheezy, tired attempt to milk more laughs out of the '60s, by doing exactly what ""Austin Powers"" did. "
686,The Love Guru,3.8,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Myers has made some funny movies, but this film could have been written on toilet walls by callow adolescents. "
687,The Love Guru,3.8,20,Austin Chronicle, It recycles gags from earlier and better Myers movies and hopes that the audience won't notice because they're too busy staring at Timberlake's bursting Speedo. 
688,The Love Guru,3.8,20,NPR," None of them -- not one, not for a moment -- is remotely funny. "
689,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,75,Philadelphia Inquirer," Graced with unusually expressive and seamless voice work by Drew Barrymore and George Lopez, the best of its kind since ""Babe."" "
690,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,70,The Hollywood Reporter," The picture might not be as fresh and clever as it could have been, but its spirited voice cast delivers the whole enchilada. "
691,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,70,L.A. Weekly," This being Disney, wholesome character-building messages abound, but for once they're freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine. "
692,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,70,Washington Post," Okay, the concept for the movie is admittedly lame, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with watching a passel of adorable pooches wrinkle their brows and bark while human voices come out of their mouths. "
693,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,63,USA Today," Alpo is served with a burrito chaser in Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Disney's fish-out-of-water comedy in which the fish is … well, read the title. "
694,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,60,Variety," A filthy-rich fantasy for these cash-strapped times, Beverly Hills Chihuahua features the voices of Drew Barrymore and much of the industry's top Latino talent in a live-action talking-dog lark that should please young pups. "
695,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," It's very slick and small children will enjoy it, but it has little of its model's special magic. "
696,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,42,The A.V. Club," This is not a movie for anyone who's aged past the ""Oh! Cute!"" phase of moviegoing. It's paced for little minds with short attention spans. "
697,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,30,Los Angeles Times," Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast. "
698,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,3.8,25,Entertainment Weekly," While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line. "
699,Holmes & Watson,3.8,42,IndieWire," The trouble with Holmes & Watson, a witless Sherlock Holmes spoof that supplies fewer laughs in its entirety than “Step Brothers” does in its deleted scenes, is that the movie can never decide how dumb it wants to be. Or, more accurately, what kind of dumb it wants to be. "
700,Holmes & Watson,3.8,40,The New York Times, There is still intermittent joy to be found in their autumnal bromance. 
701,Holmes & Watson,3.8,40,Variety," The trouble is, Sherlock Holmes exists so large in audiences’ minds already that the pair’s uninspired take feels neither definitive nor an especially fresh take, but just an off-brand, garden-variety parody. "
702,Holmes & Watson,3.8,40,Los Angeles Times," Because of the talent involved, every now and then Holmes & Watson hits on something bizarrely inspired. "
703,Holmes & Watson,3.8,33,Entertainment Weekly," A brilliant supporting cast, which includes Hugh Laurie, Steve Coogan, Ralph Fiennes, Lauren Lapkus, Rebecca Hall, and Kelly MacDonald, is utterly wasted on this lame and forgettable outing. The only real mystery is why they wanted to be apart of this project at all. "
704,Holmes & Watson,3.8,30,Austin Chronicle," Combined with some awfully lazy riffs on Holmes’s fondness for his seven-per-cent solution, Holmes & Watson is not so much a case of whodunit as it is a question why bother. "
705,Holmes & Watson,3.8,25,Movie Nation, It’s just not funny. 
706,Holmes & Watson,3.8,12,RogerEbert.com," So excruciatingly awful that you have to wonder what it was, other than their paychecks, that could have possessed the cast and crew to keep coming back each day, when it must have been obvious from the first day of shooting that the project was the most hopeless of cases imaginable. "
707,Holmes & Watson,3.8,10,The Hollywood Reporter," Making their previous vehicles Step Brothers and Talladega Nights seem the height of comic sophistication by comparison, Holmes & Watson features the duo parodying Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters to devastatingly unfunny effect. "
708,Holmes & Watson,3.8,0,The A.V. Club," If there are any new jokes left to tell about Holmes, they’re nowhere to be found in the abysmal Holmes & Watson, which might be the worst feature-length film ever made about the “consulting detective” from Baker Street. "
709,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,83,Entertainment Weekly," Far more grotesque than the first Human Centipede - in fact, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) could be the sickest B movie ever made. "
710,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,75,IndieWire," Like the original, the most shocking aspect comes from the revelation that Six can actually tell a story. "
711,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Whatever gothic originality the first Human Centipede possessed is altogether lacking in this sorry follow-up. 
712,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,25,Slant Magazine," The desire to eat someone's ass is almost always superficial; there's no thought of sustenance, and more sophisticated pleasures are usually imminent. Not so with The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). "
713,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,25,The A.V. Club, The first Human Centipede had audacity on its side. Human Centipede II has only excess. 
714,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,20,Variety," More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated. "
715,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,20,Time Out," The question remains: Exploitative films are a dime a dozen, but how low will two-faced art-film distributor IFC go? "
716,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,10,Boxoffice Magazine," Nasty and over the top, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) feels like a horror movie that hates horror fans. "
717,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,0,New York Magazine (Vulture)," The movie is a reductio ad absurdum, a sick joke taken to extremes, beginning with a goof on the notion that horror movies inspire copycats and ending with a test to determine whether some people will watch anything. "
718,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),3.8,0,Village Voice," It's perhaps the sequel we deserve. But that doesn't mean this dumb, blunt follow-up - both more unspeakably grotesque and less scary than the first film - is worth sitting through. Once Six's conceptual project becomes clear, his escalating audience-mocking torture is increasingly pointless. "
719,Mr. Magoo,3.9,60,TV Guide Magazine," Instantly forgettable but fun while it lasts, Disney's live-action adaptation of the classic cartoon is an ideal action-adventure thrill ride for kids who may be a little too young for the latest Bond extravaganza. "
720,Mr. Magoo,3.9,30,Variety," By turns frenetic and flat-footed, Mr. Magoo is an uninspired live-action comedy. "
721,Mr. Magoo,3.9,30,Los Angeles Times, Crashingly unimaginative. But its real offense is making such poor use of Nielsen. 
722,Mr. Magoo,3.9,25,San Francisco Chronicle, Only a couple of good gags in its pileup of otherwise lame jokes keep the production from being an unqualified stinker. 
723,Mr. Magoo,3.9,20,Empire," Nielsen's performance is truly dreadful, yet somehow it seems strangely fitting for the movie, which is unlikely even to engage the younger audience for whom it is so obviously intended. When even the outtakes you see over the end titles don't raise a single titter, you know you're in trouble. "
724,Mr. Magoo,3.9,20,The New York Times," Poor old Mr. Magoo should have been allowed to rest in piece. This film suggests that when you loot a crypt, you're likely to find a corpse. "
725,Mr. Magoo,3.9,12,Chicago Sun-Times, Mr. Magoo is transcendently bad. It soars above ordinary badness as the eagle outreaches the fly. There is not a laugh in it. Not one. I counted. 
726,Mr. Magoo,3.9,10,Chicago Reader," If you really hate your kids, pack them off to this slapdash farce, whose only funny moment is the PC disclaimer at the end about the Disney company's humanist concern for blind people (which even literate toddlers will have trouble understanding anyway). "
727,Mr. Magoo,3.9,0,Austin Chronicle, It's a mess best left to the nitrate ashes of forgotten film and television history. 
728,Mr. Magoo,3.9,0,Entertainment Weekly," With Mr. Magoo, it’s the filmmakers who seem blind. "
729,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,50,ReelViews," It's moderately engaging for the first half-hour, somewhat trying during the second half hour, and virtually unbearable over the final twenty minutes. It's a marginally recommendable film for kids, but not necessarily for parents. "
730,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,40,L.A. Weekly," Myers is the movie's fatal flaw, squeezing out the other characters who fatten the plot, mostly with an eye to parents. "
731,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,38,Chicago Tribune," Although a literal movie adaptation of Seuss' 1957 classic ""The Cat in the Hat"" might have run 20 minutes, is it too much to ask that the filmed material preserve the author's sensibility? "
732,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,25,Entertainment Weekly," Someone (Myers?) came up with the bright idea of turning the Cat in the Hat into the worst Vegas nightclub spritzer of 1958. He's become a furry version of Rip Taylor: a walking, talking vaudeville idiot box. "
733,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,25,Christian Science Monitor, It's a sort of soullessly cheerful cynicism that is about as far from Seuss as one can imagine. 
734,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,25,Rolling Stone, Talk about your quick-buck exploitation. 
735,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,25,Charlotte Observer," As a British politician said of a corrupt but articulate peer, ""The Cat in the Hat"" is like a rotten mackerel seen by moonlight: It shines as it stinks. "
736,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,25,Miami Herald, Charmless and grating and immediately forgettable. 
737,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,10,Dallas Observer, Such a remarkable rift between its charming source material and its heinous cinematic realization that the producers may as well have skipped the hassle of securing licensing rights and simply called this mess Mike Myers: A--hole in Fur. 
738,The Cat in the Hat,3.9,0,Village Voice, Comes scarily close to being the most unendurable Hollywood creation of the last dozen years. 
739,Prom Night,3.9,70,Variety, A surprisingly effective teen-skewing thriller that soft-pedals graphic violence (in marked contrast to the R-rated 1980 original) while generating a fair degree of suspense. 
740,Prom Night,3.9,50,TV Guide Magazine," Formulaic to the core, this reworking of the fondly remembered high-school slasher picture works surprisingly well on its own terms. "
741,Prom Night,3.9,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Without the gore, this old school slasher rehash is one anemic bore. "
742,Prom Night,3.9,30,Los Angeles Times," This is as listless, mindless and utterly useless a piece of corporate brain-clog as one is likely to come across for quite some time. "
743,Prom Night,3.9,25,ReelViews," Despite having the same title and a similar premise to a 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick (kids getting slaughtered on prom night), this is NOT a remake. In fact, it really doesn't have much of a plot. It's basically ""The O.C."" with a body count. "
744,Prom Night,3.9,20,L.A. Weekly," McCormick and screenwriter J.S. Cardone don’t have one original thought between them, but they do appear to share an obsession with characters opening hotel-room closets in which the steel hangers gleam ominously. "
745,Prom Night,3.9,20,The New York Times," The movie offers less gore than the average Band-Aid commercial and fewer scares than the elimination episodes of ""Dancing With the Stars."" "
746,Prom Night,3.9,16,The A.V. Club," There's really nothing much to Prom Night: No twists, no atmosphere, no big Grand Guignol setpieces, not a single moment when it tries to do something novel with the event, the killings, the villain, or the victims. It's a little like going on a tour of the slaughterhouse, where death is meted out with mechanical regularity, but visitors are kept at a safe, PG-13 distance from all the butchering. "
747,Prom Night,3.9,12,Boston Globe," When Jamie Lee Curtis ran from a killer in 1980's ""Prom Night,"" she was 22 and had a unique gift for belting out fear. She was the Beverly Sills of slasher flicks. That ""Prom Night"" was dumb, but it wasn't insulting in the way this remake is. "
748,Prom Night,3.9,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," A bland, timid and thoroughly un-thrilling teen thriller. "
749,RoboCop 3,4.0,60,Time Out," The familiarity of the high-armour shoot-outs and sfx-assisted set-pieces make most of this sequel feel surprisingly low-tech. Not bad entertainment, though. "
750,RoboCop 3,4.0,50,Los Angeles Times," There's probably sufficient energy and violence in RoboCop 3 to satisfy undemanding action fans, but it's as mechanical as its cyborg hero. "
751,RoboCop 3,4.0,50,TV Guide Magazine," Though the story is tired, most of ROBOCOP 3's action sequences and special effects are imaginative and effective, and the gruesomeness of the first two films has been toned down in a commercially wise attempt to make it more accessible to the younger audiences who love Robocop. "
752,RoboCop 3,4.0,50,Chicago Tribune," The show has its moments-some funny scenes, some wild stop-motion Phil Tippett computer action, some of Torn's scenery-chewing. But they're only moments. RoboCop 3's main problem is that nobody fouled up its program. It's a RoboMovie. [05 Nov 1993, p.C] "
753,RoboCop 3,4.0,40,Empire," Unsurprisingly this is the worst in the RoboCop trilogy, with the plot proving ridiculous, excelling itself particularly in the climax. For what was a promising debut, it's reputation was quickly tarnished with the drivvel such as this that followed. "
754,RoboCop 3,4.0,40,Variety," This latest widget off the RoboCop assembly line is a bit better than the first sequel, which amounts to damnation with faint praise. Limiting the gore, but not the carnage, in pursuit of a PG-13 rating and more youngsters, pic remains a cluttered, nasty exercise that seems principally intent on selling action figures. "
755,RoboCop 3,4.0,38,Chicago Sun-Times," Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because RoboCop is a brand name, I guess, and this is this year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit to take an old design and slap on some fresh chrome. "
756,RoboCop 3,4.0,37,Washington Post," The movie, which is deadly slow and full of Japanese-bashing, is also an undisguised merchandising promo. "
757,RoboCop 3,4.0,37,Washington Post," As for the conflict, it's hardly riveting and often it's downright silly. The sets and effects betray their downsized budget. And the Japanese bashing is less artful than in Rising Sun, though just as obnoxious. "
758,RoboCop 3,4.0,20,Austin Chronicle," About as two-dimensional as a comic book, RoboCop 3 should be regarded as the last strike-out. "
759,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,50,Baltimore Sun, Gets credit for avoiding the easy path. Too bad the path it chooses doesn't lead us anywhere we want to be taken. 
760,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,38,Charlotte Observer," The assault is against our ears, as the soundtrack pours forth a stream of thrash and Goth music. "
761,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,38,New York Daily News," The characters are boring, the violence generic, the suspense nonexistent. "
762,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,38,USA Today, Can't scare up a decent plot. 
763,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,38,Boston Globe," Berlinger has approached Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 with intelligence and even a bit of thematic heft. But, frankly, the cheap thrill is gone. "
764,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,25,Chicago Tribune, Resembles an old Nine Inch Nails video. Missing from the mix are any characters with whom you'd want to spend one minute around a campfire. 
765,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,10,Film.com," Admirers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" are going to be left high and dry. "
766,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,10,Salon," There's nothing scarier than a group of hormone-crazed 20-somethings, but this sequel isn't much more than a footnote of a footnote. "
767,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,0,L.A. Weekly, A schizoid monster slapped together by uneasy bedfellows. 
768,Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,4.0,0,Austin Chronicle," Guaranteed to inspire many more belly laughs than it does actual shivers. Boo, scary? I think not. "
769,Material Girls,4.0,50,TV Guide Magazine," The Duffs are certainly cute together, but not even their natural chemistry can enliven all the preachy bits about hard work and the meaning of happiness. "
770,Material Girls,4.0,50,Boston Globe," Isn't as witty, stylish, or sophisticated as the similarly themed ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Material Girls is pitched to the Seventeen crowd, and it succeeds on its own terms. These days, even pre teens live in a material world. "
771,Material Girls,4.0,50,Variety," It's less substantial than cotton candy, but Material Girls is as slickly produced as one of the Marchetta TV spots. "
772,Material Girls,4.0,38,New York Daily News, A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements. 
773,Material Girls,4.0,30,L.A. Weekly, The Duffs don't even fully commit to their characters here -- they’'e seemingly undecided about whether they can get away with being shallow and bratty without ruining their family-friendly images. 
774,Material Girls,4.0,30,The New York Times, The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story. 
775,Material Girls,4.0,25,The A.V. Club," The most shocking moment comes during the closing credits, when it's revealed that not one, not two, but three screenwriters were responsible for a plot that someone seems to have hastily slapped together after taking a walk around a Sephora outlet while listening to ""Beat Of My Heart"" on loop. "
776,Material Girls,4.0,10,Chicago Reader, Painfully unfunny comedy. 
777,Material Girls,4.0,0,New York Post, There is plenty of blame to go around for this laughless mess. 
778,Material Girls,4.0,0,The Hollywood Reporter," Even by the low standards of the genre it represents, this female teen comedy represents a new nadir. "
779,Norbit,4.0,50,Austin Chronicle, The fun in Norbit is watching Murphy at work – the guy has a knack for bringing the physicality of his comic characters to life. 
780,Norbit,4.0,40,The New York Times," Not exactly uproarious. But Mr. Murphy, going back at least to his Gumby and Buckwheat days on ""Saturday Night Live,"" has always had the ability to turn broad caricature into something stranger and more inventive. "
781,Norbit,4.0,30,Washington Post," Much of the movie -- which Murphy wrote with a small posse of collaborators -- is taken up with the torturously dull, not to mention unbelievable, romance between Norbit and Kate (a disappointingly lackluster Newton) and the tedious agenda of Cuba Gooding Jr. as a schemer-manipulator. "
782,Norbit,4.0,25,Entertainment Weekly," Murphy speaks in a breathy lisp, as if his mouth had been partially buttoned shut, and he doesn't give himself the nerd's traditional redeeming feature of a geeky, slide-rule intellect. Norbit, all frozen gawk, is just a very dim bulb. "
783,Norbit,4.0,25,New York Daily News, It's hard to know who is the intended audience for this misguided mess. 
784,Norbit,4.0,25,TV Guide Magazine," Mean-spirited and depressing, this horror movie in comedy disguise delights in the twin spectacles of morbid obesity and domestic abuse, of which children are often the target. "
785,Norbit,4.0,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Racially insensitive, politically incorrect and beyond crude. "
786,Norbit,4.0,20,Los Angeles Times," Murphy and his brother Charlie, who collaborated on the screenplay, seem to have drawn the wrong lesson from the latter's stint on ""Chappelle's Show."" Where Dave Chappelle used stereotypes to confront prejudice, the Murphys (and their co-screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronn) merely squeeze a few grudging drops from caricatures that were wrung dry in the age of vaudeville. "
787,Norbit,4.0,10,L.A. Weekly," It's an astonishingly crass and vulgar film, crudely directed on a cut-rate budget by Brian Robbins, never more than almost funny or less than disturbing. "
788,Norbit,4.0,0,Seattle Post-Intelligencer, It's recidivist Murphy: bad-skit comedy populated by caricatures in search of a movie. 
789,One Missed Call,4.0,50,TV Guide Magazine," The result is yet another tired, ultimately incoherent horror movie that undoes the promise of its pretty good premise and potentially interesting story structure with dull scares, sloppy ending and a pair of unconvincing, leaden lead performances. "
790,One Missed Call,4.0,42,The A.V. Club," On the shortlist for least essential movie of the decade, a copy of a copy of a copy that's so worn down, it's about as fresh and vital as a fifth-generation dub of ""The Star Wars Holiday Special."" "
791,One Missed Call,4.0,40,Variety, This decent if derivative scare machine should benefit from a lack of genre competition. 
792,One Missed Call,4.0,38,ReelViews, Uninspired and painfully familiar. 
793,One Missed Call,4.0,38,Chicago Tribune," While director Eric Valette provides the occasional chill, the disturbing spooks aren't enough to make this boat float. Burns sleepwalks through One Missed Call totally devoid of charisma, and Sossamon muddles along, going through the motions. "
794,One Missed Call,4.0,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), Give this call a miss. 
795,One Missed Call,4.0,30,The New York Times, A poker-faced puzzle whose biggest shock is the absence of Sarah Michelle Gellar. 
796,One Missed Call,4.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter," The direction is uninspired, acting is lifeless, and the script borders on the inept. "
797,One Missed Call,4.0,12,Boston Globe, One Missed Call was originally a so-so Takashi Miike freak-out. Now it's a worse-worse American eyesore. 
798,One Missed Call,4.0,10,Film Threat," The original movie One Missed Call is based on was pretty tame, at least by Miike standards. And since it appears studios have no intention of halting this flood of abysmal rehashes, allow me to suggest that they at least have the stones not to pussyfoot around and give us a remake worthy of Hollywood, of America, and of an audience that lacks the willpower to stop buying tickets to half-assed crap. "
799,Shark Night 3D,4.0,65,Movieline," Shark Night isn't fantastic, but it's a good enough time, and it'll never be better than when it's watched with a rowdy crowd in a theater. "
800,Shark Night 3D,4.0,50,Slant Magazine," It's refreshing to see Shark Night 3D director David R. Ellis try to pull off a semi-sincere second-generation ""Jaws"" rip-off, even if he doesn't quite succeed. "
801,Shark Night 3D,4.0,40,Time Out, The equivalent of a skin flick in which all the sex scenes are tastefully obscured by blankets and sheets. 
802,Shark Night 3D,4.0,30,Variety," Unlike his ""Snakes on a Plane,"" director David R. Ellis' sharks-in-a-lake thriller displays little sense of its scenario's camp potential. Gore, too, is in short supply on account of the pic's PG-13 rating, which renders the attack scenes nearly toothless. "
803,Shark Night 3D,4.0,30,The Hollywood Reporter," The PG-13 film is heavy on scenes of cloudy blood in the water but almost entirely lacking shock shots of flesh torn asunder. (And while marketing relies heavily on bikinis, the movie's light on that kind of flesh as well.) "
804,Shark Night 3D,4.0,25,Orlando Sentinel," The worst movie of the summer, arriving on the last weekend of the summer. "
805,Shark Night 3D,4.0,25,Entertainment Weekly," A ho-hum series of kills and lulls so predictable that it doesn't even look like much fun for the sharks; when they open wide, they might as well be yawning. "
806,Shark Night 3D,4.0,20,New York Daily News," The one crime a B-movie should never commit is boring its audience. By even these low standards, Shark Night 3D is dead in the water. "
807,Shark Night 3D,4.0,20,Boxoffice Magazine," A thoroughly shabby attempt to piggyback on the success of last year's ""Piranha 3D,"" Shark Night 3D embraces convention with a voraciousness matched only by its predictability, amateurishness and all-around tameness. "
808,Shark Night 3D,4.0,0,The A.V. Club," Shark Night 3D barely bothered to show up, let alone deliver the minimal goods. "
809,11-11-11,4.0,50,The Hollywood Reporter," After multiple ""Saw"" franchise releases, writer-director Darren Lynn Bousman goes it alone for 11-11-11, with at best tepid results elaborating an unconvincing premise. "
810,11-11-11,4.0,40,Variety," One and one (and one and one and one and one) never quite add up to two in Darren Lynn Bousman's 11-11-11, a rather anemic entry in the biblical-prophecy horror subgenre. "
811,11-11-11,4.0,35,Movieline," The film has the feel of something conceived and whipped together in very little time, perhaps to make its own built-in deadline. "
812,11-11-11,4.0,30,Los Angeles Times, If only 11-11-11 had arrived a little closer to Thanksgiving - the turkey connection would have been entirely appropriate. 
813,11-11-11,4.0,20,Time Out," A veteran of the Saw franchise, Darren Lynn Bousman trades torture-porn antics for an old-fashioned Euro-horror vibe, complete with old dark houses and creepy maids; he then wastes what little suspense he generates with endless dorm-room philosophical debates about faith versus atheism and religio-conspiracy theories so far-fetched they'd embarrass Dan Brown. "
814,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,60,Los Angeles Times," The Last Exorcism Part II is an effectively unnerving, slow-burn supernatural horror tale. The film is smartly different enough from the original to survive on its own, though it lacks some of the first film's sense of surprise. "
815,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,60,The New York Times," At least this movie, like its predecessor, has Ashley Bell as Nell. An actress who suggests religious piety, carnal fire and satanic aggression with equal dexterity, Ms. Bell provides a pulse an audience can connect with amid the standard-issue atmospheric accouterments. "
816,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,58,Entertainment Weekly," Unfortunately, no one involved seems to have bent over backwards to make the movie either original or even all that scary. "
817,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,50,Film.com," At the end of the day, it’s a sure-handed sequel, but not a terribly thrilling one. "
818,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Unfortunately, while director/co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly displays an admirable restraint in his general eschewing of gratuitous gore, quick editing and flashy visuals, the results have a generally soporific feel. "
819,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,25,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," Part II is every bit as cheap and far more generic, nothing more than a run of the mill ghost story masquerading as The Devil Made Her Do It. "
820,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,25,The Playlist, It’s the kind of garbage that does a disservice to the fearless possibilities of the horror genre and its knack for sly social commentary. 
821,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,25,Washington Post, An ineffective excursion that maintains a few direct ties back to the original film but never moves the story forward. 
822,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,25,The A.V. Club," An abysmal sequel that abandons the found-footage concept, along with the pockets of wit and originality that made its predecessor salvageable. "
823,The Last Exorcism Part II,4.0,25,Slant Magazine," Scenes of solemn importance drag on to the point of self-parody in an attempt at establishing mood, while dialogue reeks of connect-the-dots spoonfeeding. "
824,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,60,Los Angeles Times," It makes clearer much that was so vague in the original; it even jokes about how confusing its premise is. In short, audiences who made the first film successful enough to warrant a second will be getting a bit more for their money. "
825,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,50,Washington Post," With its fancifully moldering sets and technical effects, Highlander 2 is little more than a barbarous arena, a Conanistic return to paganism for those among us who still laugh at violence. "
826,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,40,Empire," No plot, no real story, no point really. "
827,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,40,IGN," The problem is – the film plays more like a brainstorm exercise than a feature length film. There are gobs of great ideas here, but none of them connect in the way fans likely wanted. "
828,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,40,Variety, Audiences unfamiliar with the first film will be hard put to follow the action as it incoherently hops about in time and space. 
829,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,30,Austin Chronicle," The acting is terrible,with Connery, at his lowest common denominator, stealing the show. For those of you who worry that MTV video art will destroy cinema, the ineptitudes of this film vividly detail the radical difference in forms. It sucks. But it would have made a great comic book. "
830,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,25,TV Guide Magazine, Highlander 2 is beautiful. But it's largely incoherent. The film is desperately overplotted; events and years rush by and pile up like cars in an interstate wreck. It's also terribly overexplained. 
831,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,25,Boston Globe," The dullest and shoddiest action-adventure flick of the year, with only a few cute Sean Connery moments to rescue it from total, sheer and utter bogosity. [01 Nov 1991, p.29] "
832,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,20,Time Out," Leaden, laden with effects, short on imagination. "
833,Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,12,Chicago Sun-Times, Highlander 2: The Quickening is the most hilariously incomprehensible movie I've seen in many a long day - a movie almost awesome in its badness. 
834,Inspector Gadget,4.1,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Inspector Gadget may be a live-action movie, but at its heart it's more cartoonish than most cartoons. "
835,Inspector Gadget,4.1,40,TV Guide Magazine," What a joyless, fussy contraption of a movie! "
836,Inspector Gadget,4.1,38,Chicago Sun-Times, The plot was an arbitrary concoction. 
837,Inspector Gadget,4.1,30,Los Angeles Times," Gadget instead ends up as another mindless, noisy thrill ride that gorges its audience on bright effects and leaves it queasy from overconsumption. "
838,Inspector Gadget,4.1,30,The New York Times, In the end the elaborate gimmickry of Inspector Gadget cannot conceal its very ordinary storytelling. 
839,Inspector Gadget,4.1,30,Austin Chronicle," Like the cartoon on which it's based, Inspector Gadget has moments of absurd fun and droll wit, but they are fleeting and few. "
840,Inspector Gadget,4.1,25,ReelViews," Disney has struck once again, taking a passably entertaining cartoon and turning it into a motion picture so lifeless that it's almost unwatchable. "
841,Inspector Gadget,4.1,20,The A.V. Club, Anyone older than eight is likely to find it a ridiculously extravagant exercise in stupidity. 
842,Inspector Gadget,4.1,20,Dallas Observer, Are there really legions of postboomers out there sighing nostalgically over the happy hours they spent watching Inspector Gadget? 
843,Inspector Gadget,4.1,10,Variety," A new standard for wretched excess is established by Inspector Gadget, a joyless and charmless disaster in which state-of-the-art special effects are squandered on pain-in-the-backside folly. "
844,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,50,Chicago Reader," Rosenthal observes all the ritual elements -- a veteran of the series, he seems to understand that its fans crave certainty over shock. "
845,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,40,New Times (L.A.)," Thing is, movie's 100 percent mystery-free, but mildly creative, mixing Psych 101 with cynical Hollywood in-jokes with Tylenol-sponsored grainy-cam footage. Best revelation is source of Myers' superhuman strength: eats big rats, apparently. "
846,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,30,L.A. Weekly," If, as it appears, Rosenthal is competing with the knife-wielding Myers for the title of biggest hack, he wins by unanimous decision. "
847,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,30,The A.V. Club, It seems content to plod listlessly through the motions. 
848,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,25,ReelViews," There's no evidence of craftsmanship or energy. Everything, from the plot to the execution, is plodding and obligatory. "
849,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,25,San Francisco Chronicle, Cheesy. 
850,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,20,The New York Times," Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning. "
851,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,10,Variety, More uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels. 
852,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,0,New York Post," It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even ""Jason X"" - a recent attempt to prolong the rival ""Friday the 13th"" slasher franchise - look positively Shakesperean by comparison. "
853,Halloween: Resurrection,4.1,0,Austin Chronicle, Forget this dreck: Where's that Michael vs. Jason grudge match we've been hearing about for the last decade? 
854,Torque,4.1,80,Los Angeles Times," A terrific action picture, fast-moving, studded with great stunts and smart enough not to take itself too seriously. Amid a plethora of high-minded, big-deal, year-end Oscar contenders, it offers a welcome contrast (and respite). "
855,Torque,4.1,75,Entertainment Weekly," The movie is a guzzle of yahoo-Mountain Dew empty-calorie satisfaction: A quick blood-sugar high, an eyeful of bikes and bosoms, and you're out of the theater in 80 minutes. And on a bleak winter's day, that can be meal enough. "
856,Torque,4.1,75,Christian Science Monitor," The movie is as adolescent as it sounds, but Kahn keeps your eyes popping with truly nonstop action and some of the most outlandishly inventive effects you've ever seen. And of course Cube is so supercool it's worth the price of admission just to watch him. "
857,Torque,4.1,70,L.A. Weekly," Zippy, stylish fun. "
858,Torque,4.1,50,ReelViews," The film occasionally pokes fun at itself, although not nearly as often as it should. I don't recommend it for anything more significant than a bottom-of-the-barrel rental or a desperation cable choice, but it delivers what it advertises, and I suppose that could be considered a virtue. "
859,Torque,4.1,50,USA Today," The cycle thrills here are everything: flips, collisions, a chase across the top of a fast-moving train and even a zoom down the aisle of one of the train's cars as the passengers take it in stride. "
860,Torque,4.1,50,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Purely an easy-to-digest testosterone flick anyway, with standard bikini babes, roaring engines and bikers who circle each other slowly in the dust before they rumble. "
861,Torque,4.1,38,Chicago Tribune, It may entertain you if you don't mind senseless stories and screaming soundtracks. 
862,Torque,4.1,30,Washington Post, With the exception of a few dazzling special effects and a digitally enhanced camera move or two... it's also a towering bore. 
863,Torque,4.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," With the exception of a decent train-top chase, Torque is all vroom and no action. "
864,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The unchecked enthusiasm of McGinley as the touchy-feely renovation guru gives slow-burn Cube the perfect foil and mellows the malicious comic tone. The rest is pure slapstick. 
865,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,50,Los Angeles Times," Although Ice Cube is still happy to haul out his old snarl when it serves his purposes, he's clearly trying to reinvent himself as a family entertainer. But the milder he gets, the less confident he seems. What's a reformed gangsta rapper to do? "
866,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Tpicture delivers the requisite number of pratfalls, and the genial Ice Cube makes for a credibly hapless everyman, but the comedy still feels a little too safely soft around the edges. "
867,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,50,New York Post," While the latest installment avoids the nonstop parade of potty jokes, it never rises much past the level of mediocrity. "
868,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Obvious, but at least it's clean. "
869,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,40,Village Voice, Fans of the first film can rest assured that a change in the director's chair has done little to curb the overall tone of slapstick desperation. 
870,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,40,Variety," Supposedly based on ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" but has about as much to do with that frothy Cary Grant confection as a Yugo has to do with a 1948 Buick Roadster. "
871,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,40,The New York Times," An ill-advised sequel to ""Are We There Yet?"" and a feeble fable of better parenting through home improvement. "
872,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,38,Chicago Tribune," Calling a sequel Are We Done Yet? is like calling it ""Enough Already."" "
873,Are We Done Yet?,4.1,38,USA Today, Been-there-seen-that wannabe laughfest. 
874,The Last Airbender,4.1,63,USA Today," He hasn't mastered the craft yet, but M. Night Shyamalan may be on to something with this action-movie thing. "
875,The Last Airbender,4.1,50,Entertainment Weekly," The movie is ""Star Wars"" with martial arts, plus a touch of ""The Last Emperor."" Technically, it's not badly done; I enjoyed the physical clash of elements, the water balls rising like sculpture in the air. "
876,The Last Airbender,4.1,38,St. Louis Post-Dispatch, A toxic potion that will put children to sleep and kill his (M. Night Shyamalan) career. 
877,The Last Airbender,4.1,30,Arizona Republic," While the special effects are impressive enough, M. Night Shyamalan's film doesn't make a lick of sense. "
878,The Last Airbender,4.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Even during the climax, the film still is struggling to introduce the world of the film and its strange rules. "
879,The Last Airbender,4.1,25,Boston Globe," The Last Airbender' is dreadful, an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film ""The Golden Compass,'' a similarly botched adaptation of a beloved property from another medium, look like a four-star classic. "
880,The Last Airbender,4.1,25,Orlando Sentinel," This colossal folly, the fiasco of the summer of 2010 - gives us all a ringside seat at the sight of Mr. ""I See Dead People's"" career gurgling down the drain. "
881,The Last Airbender,4.1,20,Variety," This is all enormously disappointing, of course, since the best we could hope for from a live-action ""Avatar"" adaptation is the mind-blowing equivalent of our first encounters with wire-fu, rather than this cartoony nonsense. "
882,The Last Airbender,4.1,12,Chicago Sun-Times, The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. 
883,The Last Airbender,4.1,0,The A.V. Club," The Last Airbender isn't that much different from the rest of this summer's generally dire multiplex fare-from ""The A-Team"" to ""Jonah Hex""... But it is remarkable in one respect: It's the worst of them. "
884,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,70,Village Voice," Director Jay Lee (The Slaughter) delivers absolutely everything you could possibly hope for in a film called Zombie Strippers, with a consistently hilarious, brutal, and titillating mash-up of ""Return of the Living Dead"" and ""Showgirls"" that actually beats out Mark Pirro's ""Nudist Colony of the Dead"" for the unofficial title of best naked zombie movie ever. "
885,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,70,Los Angeles Times, Zombie Strippers is a B-movie whose ideas and wit set it well above the great unwashed of the genre. 
886,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,63,Premiere," Whatever planet these dance sequences are happening on, their cuckoo surrealism is the movie's saving grace. "
887,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,63,TV Guide Magazine," On its own low-bar terms, it delivers the goods: pole-dancing, gut-chomping and Jenna J. "
888,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,63,Boston Globe, Shouting the title never quite prepared me for either how stripping zombies aren't as hot or as funny as I thought they would be or how quickly the movie's eager intelligence collapses on itself. 
889,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,50,New York Post," Shot on ugly digital video with Troma-grade special effects, campy humor and frighteningly bad acting, Zombie Strippers should provide many laughs for stoners watching it on video. "
890,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,50,The New York Times," Strewn with some surprisingly decent effects, this unevenly paced film delivers, if nothing else, on the promise of its title: lots of surgically enhanced nude dead women strutting their stuff. "
891,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,50,The Hollywood Reporter, Jay Lee's grotesque little horror film makes up for in audacity what it might lack in finesse. 
892,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,40,Austin Chronicle," The action can be bloody, but is mostly routine. Ultimately, the film’s most eye-catching special effects are reserved for bikini waxes and implants. "
893,Zombie Strippers!,4.1,25,The A.V. Club," Currently stopping by theaters briefly en route to DVD, the film tries to position Jameson as the next Linnea Quigley, the B-movie queen behind such enduring titles as ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" and ""Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama."" "
894,The Apparition,4.1,40,Boxoffice Magazine," The soulless-ness of their empty plot of track homes and super-store existence invokes both ""Poltergeist"" and ""Employee of the Month."" "
895,The Apparition,4.1,38,Boston Globe," To those of us in the audience who might be strangers in paranormal precincts, it looks suspiciously like a séance. "
896,The Apparition,4.1,30,Movieline," An incomprehensibly garbled, derivative attempt at a horror flick from first-time writer-director Todd Lincoln. "
897,The Apparition,4.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Lincoln's script has no knack for the pacing of cinematic exorcisms, and the truncated climax he does offer is short on action and scares. "
898,The Apparition,4.1,25,The A.V. Club," It's a potentially creepy setting that would give an innovative director a chance to do a lot with a little. Unfortunately, Lincoln isn't one of those. "
899,The Apparition,4.1,25,The Playlist," A plodding, undercooked, and old-fashioned (not in a good way, either) chiller that will bore you to tears instead of scare you to death. "
900,The Apparition,4.1,20,Time Out," The Apparition turns out to be nothing more than a series of feebly constructed ""Boo!"" scenes tacked together to achieve (barely) feature length. "
901,The Apparition,4.1,20,Variety," This enervating muddle of paranormal nonsense manages the difficult feat of seeming frenzied and lethargic all at once, while building toward the sort of ludicrous cop-out climax that often incites die-hard genre fans to shout rude things at the screen. "
902,The Apparition,4.1,16,Entertainment Weekly," With more telegraphed scares than Samuel Morse on Halloween, it still might give you a restless night, but only because you fell asleep in the theater. "
903,The Apparition,4.1,12,Slant Magazine," The story is a worthy one, but the film lacks any daring expressive touches that might have made it, at the very least, noteworthy. "
904,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,75,New York Post," The film never pretends to be other than what it really is: soft-core porn for the ladies, diluted with an “R” rating. "
905,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,70,The Hollywood Reporter," With a loose-limbed naturalness, she conveys naiveté, intellectual curiosity and romantic yearning, and shows the unassuming Ana’s newfound thrill at being seen, however complicated the man holding her in his admiring gaze. She’s open and vulnerable but no fool. Best of all, Johnson and her director embrace Ana’s paradox: She snickers at Christian’s predilections, but they also turn her on. "
906,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,67,Entertainment Weekly," I spoil nothing by reporting what readers already know, that when Fifty Shades is not a dirty story, it is, as the trilogy unfolds, a study in cartoonishly weird family dynamics. "
907,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,65,TheWrap," Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan, Taylor-Johnson’s erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James’ first book that captures the heady exhilaration of being someone’s fixation. "
908,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,60,New York Daily News," Credit goes to director Sam Taylor-Johnson and her screenwriter, Kelly Marcel, who've stripped the first book of its biggest flaws, while still honoring its essence. And lead Dakota Johnson makes for an ideal heroine, though — as doubters feared — her chemistry with costar Jamie Dornan doesn't always sizzle. "
909,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,60,Time Out," Fifty Shades of Grey is a sex-positive but hopelessly soft-core erotic drama that fails to be even a fraction as titillating as the E.L. James books that inspired it. And yet, that’s exactly why it works. "
910,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,60,Variety," Glossy, well cast, and a consistent hoot until it becomes a serious drag, this neo-“9½ Weeks” is above all a slick exercise in carefully brand-managed titillation — edgier than most grown-up studio fare, but otherwise a fairly mild provocation in this porn-saturated day and age. "
911,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,60,The Guardian," Johnson’s Ana squeezes believability out of one of the more silly romantic entanglements in recent popular culture. It’s all there in her face, which Taylor-Johnson frames in close-up. She’s fully aware this scenario is ridiculous, but can’t seem to turn away from its lunacy. "
912,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,60,Village Voice," The film strips Fifty Shades of Grey to its essentials: a confident man, an awkward girl, and a red room rimmed with leather handcuffs. From there, Taylor-Johnson rebuilds. She constructs an erotic dramedy that takes its romance seriously even as it admits that Christian Grey's very existence is absurd. "
913,Fifty Shades of Grey,4.1,42,IndieWire," Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcel's screenplay, the considerable talent behind the camera and a modicum of considerable performances yield a few undeniable guilty pleasures, but most viewers will be seeking a safe word to escape this two-hour-plus mess of half-baked excess. "
914,Devil's Due,4.1,67,The Playlist," If there's a problem that gets in the way of some genuinely scary moments, it's that the filmmakers (all four of them) don't ever give you enough information to invest in the characters. "
915,Devil's Due,4.1,58,The A.V. Club," While it’s generally above-average for this sorry genre, it’s so derivative, in both style and narrative, that there’s still an overwhelming sense of plodding inevitability to the whole affair. "
916,Devil's Due,4.1,40,The Telegraph," Oscillates between the jolting and the absurd, bottoming out with a nonsensical coda. "
917,Devil's Due,4.1,40,Empire," An ordinary, forgettable horror film. Even the Devil deserves more than this. "
918,Devil's Due,4.1,40,Time Out London," Devil’s Due spends far too much time on home movie footage of likeable newlyweds Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller), while neglecting to scare the bejesus out of us. "
919,Devil's Due,4.1,40,The Guardian," It's as substantial as seeing ""The Exorcist"" redone on Snapchat – and let's not even consider the implication of casting black and Latino performers as Satan's minions, because clearly its makers haven't. "
920,Devil's Due,4.1,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," The dialogue is dull, the performances perfunctory and while it is novel to leave out “the explainer” character — that slim hope that a priest, an expert on the Occult or whoever, can give the characters answers — common to this genre, leaving that character out robs the film of pathos and urgency. "
921,Devil's Due,4.1,30,Variety," The film expends plenty of effort crafting a few memorable freakout setpieces and nailing down the logistics of its found-footage camera placement, yet it offers precious little in the way of real scares or engaging characters, and even less in original ideas. "
922,Devil's Due,4.1,30,The Hollywood Reporter," As with most found footage films, there’s a lot of tediousness, with the early proceedings resembling the sort of home movies from which anyone not directly involved would normally flee. "
923,Devil's Due,4.1,25,RogerEbert.com, Devil's Due is one of those films that borrows so many key elements from other and often better movies that genre buffs could amuse themselves by composing lists of all the titles that it blatantly rips off throughout. 
924,Fair Game,4.2,50,Chicago Sun-Times, Fair Game works as a thriller for anyone who lives entirely in the present. 
925,Fair Game,4.2,50,Entertainment Weekly, A thriller primarily about the movement of Cindy Crawford's breasts beneath a succession of ever-smaller T-shirts. 
926,Fair Game,4.2,50,San Francisco Chronicle, Will you find yourself wishing you were looking at someone else? Not really. 
927,Fair Game,4.2,25,San Francisco Examiner, This is right up there with the dumbest pictures of the year. 
928,Fair Game,4.2,12,ReelViews," Fair Game is howlingly bad - so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level. "
929,Fair Game,4.2,12,Rolling Stone," Fair Game, written and directed by men, allows model Cindy Crawford to make her screen debut as Miami lawyer Kate McQueen. "
930,Fair Game,4.2,12,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), The film is significantly inept even when Crawford is not on the screen. [03 Nov 1995] 
931,Fair Game,4.2,11,Austin Chronicle," Very slick and extremely silly, not to mention aptly titled, Fair Game is just that - a noisy actioner so inanely scripted, acted, and directed that it practically begs you to make fun of it. "
932,Fair Game,4.2,10,The New York Times, The only heat that rises from the movie is mechanical. 
933,Fair Game,4.2,0,Los Angeles Times, Don't imagine there is any reason to see Fair Game. 
934,Wing Commander,4.2,67,Austin Chronicle," While much of the film is taken over by enormously entertaining dogfight sequences … much of it also rests on the narrative drive, which seems clipped part and parcel from one of those old “Why We Fight” documentaries that Frank Capra doled out to keep our G.I.s in fighting mode. "
935,Wing Commander,4.2,50,TV Guide Magazine," The script too often sounds like an encrypted communique itself, and it's tiring trying to keep all the nonsensical space-jargon straight. The effort is more demanding than hanging onto a joystick, and not entirely worth the effort. "
936,Wing Commander,4.2,30,Salon," Pretty much everything in this high-space war yarn has been swiped from other, better movies. "
937,Wing Commander,4.2,30,Variety," Formulaic, humdrum and sometimes unintentionally laughable. "
938,Wing Commander,4.2,20,L.A. Weekly," An excruciating no-brainer blend of “Starship Troopers” and “Top Gun,” without the former’s guilty-pleasure concoction of gory F/X and dark humor or Tom Cruise’s megawatt smile. "
939,Wing Commander,4.2,20,Chicago Reader, Excruciatingly earnest yet convictionless movie. 
940,Wing Commander,4.2,20,Washington Post, Cinematic sleeping pill. 
941,Wing Commander,4.2,10,Newsweek," Matthew Lillard of ""Scream,"" flies like his nickname and tries to bring the film some comic relief not already provided by the stultifying stupidity of the script. "
942,Wing Commander,4.2,10,The New York Times, The film is painfully boring and funny in the wrong places. 
943,Wing Commander,4.2,0,Entertainment Weekly," The effects are laughably primitive, the dialogue hilariously atrocious -- and those are the good parts. "
944,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,75,Chicago Sun-Times," Has the same mixture of dumb puns, corny sight gags and sly, even sophisticated in-jokes. It's a lot of fun. "
945,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,63,USA Today, Pure nonsense is hard to sustain for an entire feature-length movie. 
946,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,50,San Francisco Chronicle," So quick that the flat moments are rapidly, inevitably chased by a new gag. "
947,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,50,TV Guide Magazine, This megastar mix of CGI animation and live action is remarkably faithful to the spirit of the original. 
948,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,42,Entertainment Weekly, The problem with the movie isn't that it sells out Rocky and Bullwinkle -- it's that it can't keep up with them. 
949,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,40,Austin Chronicle," Hit-or-miss comedy at its best and worst: When it connects, the belly laughs are long and loud, but when it misses, the groans you'll be hearing are your own. "
950,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,40,Washington Post, Never asks its target audience of self-referential baby boomers and their littles bundles of joy to take it more seriously than it takes itself. 
951,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,30,Film.com," Has some good throwaway gags -- but far too often, the moviemakers don't throw them away soon enough. "
952,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,20,The New York Times," Succumbs to its blockbuster ambitions and turns into a noisy, bloated mess. "
953,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,4.2,10,Variety," Scarcely seems worth the expenditure of time, money and talent. "
954,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,75,San Francisco Chronicle, Has a shameless B-movie exuberance. 
955,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,33,Entertainment Weekly, Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest dud. 
956,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,30,TNT RoughCut, This testosterone-fest even features a battle inside a strip bar replete with topless women. Talk about your guilty pleasures. 
957,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,30,Variety, Lightning fails to strike twice -- an underwhelming follow-up to one of the career-stalled action star's better efforts. 
958,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,25,Boston Globe, Devoid of personality and has an annoying gratuitous sentimental streak. 
959,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,20,TV Guide Magazine," Plenty of bone-crunching brawn, but not a brain cell in sight. "
960,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,20,Film.com, Custom-made for an audience of mouth-breathers. 
961,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,10,Film.com," Slow-moving and violent mess...feels slow even at a scant 82 minutes...Even by the slack standards of Van Damme's oeuvre, ""The Return"" is a letdown. "
962,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,10,L.A. Weekly, A mind-numbing exercise in high body counts and big tits. 
963,Universal Soldier: The Return,4.2,0,Austin Chronicle," Lame, mindless dialogue makes Wing Commander seem Cukoresque by comparison. "
964,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,38,Boston Globe, Awful in ways that are just clever enough often enough to make it intermittently watchable. 
965,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,30,TV Guide Magazine, Preposterous plotting and interchangeable young actors. 
966,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,25,Miami Herald, Sophomoric. 
967,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,20,The New York Times," Ottman doesn't have the firm grasp of tone necessary to make his deliberate ambiguities seem other than simple confusion, nor the sense of humor necessary to turn the deliberate clichés into effective satire. "
968,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,20,L.A. Weekly, Wears its lack of originality in a crowded slasher marketplace like a red badge of desperation. 
969,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,12,Baltimore Sun, Just plain bad. 
970,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,12,Chicago Tribune, It's hard not to feel angry that you've spent almost two hours watching this moronic exercise. 
971,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,10,Variety, A poorer film than the paltry original even as it strikes a self-consciously clever pose. 
972,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,0,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," No style, no irony and no smarts, just a vicious streak that lasts 90 minutes. "
973,Urban Legends: Final Cut,4.2,0,Entertainment Weekly, Debased swill. 
974,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,67,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Though he tries hard for bravado, hero Edward Burns is terminally wooden. "
975,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,50,ReelViews," The ending seems predestined, and the overlong, tepid journey getting to that point isn't worth the price of admission. "
976,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,38,USA Today," The cliché-laden dialogue, schlocky special effects and predictable plot are derivative; the movie is overwrought and lacks suspense. "
977,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,38,New York Daily News," Burns doesn't even bother to disguise his New York accent, any more than he does his boredom. "
978,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,25,Chicago Tribune, One redeeming feature of this picture is that it will make great fodder for those make-fun-of-the-movie TV shows. 
979,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,20,The Hollywood Reporter," A gloriously lead-footed excursion into time travel with all the accoutrements of 1950s science fiction: an absurd plot, cliched characters, corny effects and a race against time to save mankind. "
980,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,20,Variety, A clunky and cheesy disaster. 
981,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,20,The New York Times, This picture achieves a level of badness that is its own form of sublimity. You almost - please note that I said almost - have to see it to believe it. 
982,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,20,Los Angeles Times," The picture looks as murky as its story line, the sound is tinny, much of the dialogue is flat or confoundingly technical or merely risible, and most everything on the screen looks patently fake. "
983,A Sound of Thunder,4.2,20,TV Guide Magazine, The profoundly unconvincing CGI work only makes the sorry screenplay and lackluster performances look worse. 
984,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,100,Film Threat," There are no boring, expository sequences; no depressing, grown-up politics. Instead, Rodriguez gifts us with a kaleidoscope of energy and invention. "
985,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,80,Los Angeles Times," A good example of complex Hollywood wizardry placed in the service of sharp, intelligent family entertainment. "
986,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,75,USA Today," Amid the razzle-dazzle, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is sweetly inspiring. "
987,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,75,Philadelphia Inquirer," Rodriguez manages to work in some nicely cornball messages (family togetherness and forgiveness is good, Stallone doing comedy is bad) and theatergoers get to walk out with their very own way-cool cardboard anaglyphic eyeglasses. "
988,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,63,Miami Herald," Easily the slightest and most frenetic entry in the trilogy. But it might also turn out to be the fan favorite, because the movie is nothing but eye candy and visual sensation. "
989,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,63,ReelViews," It's an awkward technique that outlived its usefulness more than four decades ago. I like the movie, but hate its presentation. "
990,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,60,The New York Times," An enjoyable, noisy romp. "
991,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,60,Variety," It's hard to dislike a movie this light-hearted, but there's something terribly ephemeral about it as well; it's a film of complete weightlessness. "
992,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,50,Baltimore Sun," Good intentions are no substitute for good filmmaking, and Spy Kids 3D is nothing more than a retread in flashier clothing. "
993,Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,40,TV Guide Magazine," Overall it's a harmless disappointment, hampered by the thin story and a surprisingly dreary looking video-game setting, heavy on the floating platforms, cartoony future-cityscapes and goofy gadgetry. "
994,Boogeyman,4.2,70,Variety, Trendy influence of insidiously creepy Japanese horror pics is felt in almost every frame of Boogeyman. The effectively atmospheric and unusually involving thriller tells the story of a distraught young man's protracted duel of wits with the eponymous evildoer. 
995,Boogeyman,4.2,60,Film Threat," This film does cause shivers, creeps, scares, and jumps. It may even make you scream a bit. "
996,Boogeyman,4.2,50,San Francisco Chronicle, An otherwise passable horror film that delivers more than enough cheap thrills to forgive the plot holes. 
997,Boogeyman,4.2,40,Los Angeles Times, Has little to offer in the way of entertainment or originality. 
998,Boogeyman,4.2,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," A film willing to cheat whatever way necessary to scare you... The good news is that once you leave the theatre, you'll never think of Boogeyman again. "
999,Boogeyman,4.2,38,Philadelphia Inquirer," While stylishly filmed and edited, Boogeyman is filled with every imaginable fright cliche... It's like a meal consisting entirely of airy hors d'oeuvres. "
1000,Boogeyman,4.2,30,The New York Times," The filmmakers are smart enough to keep the monster out of sight for a long time and then to show only glimpses, but a similar tactic of providing only glimpses of plot and character is disastrous. "
1001,Boogeyman,4.2,25,New York Post," The MPAA's rating explanation for this PG-13-rated snoozer misleadingly claims it contains ""intense sequences of terror/violence""; it would be more accurate to state that Boogeyman contains ""virtually every horror-movie cliché of the past 30 years."" "
1002,Boogeyman,4.2,20,TV Guide Magazine," If you can't spell ""bogeyman,"" you shouldn't make movies about him. "
1003,Boogeyman,4.2,12,Boston Globe," A horror film whose only scare is that it was made at all... As with so many stupid horror movies in these post-''Scream"" times, this one is at such a creative loss that all it can do is make its audience feel duped for having purchased a ticket. "
1004,The Comebacks,4.2,63,Boston Globe," As dumb spoofs go, The Comebacks isn't bad. It takes almost every sports movie of the last five years (""Field of Dreams,"" too) and blends them into a single slapdash comedy. "
1005,The Comebacks,4.2,50,Film Threat," It’s mostly eighty-four minutes of puns, double entendres, and Freudian slips. "
1006,The Comebacks,4.2,40,Los Angeles Times," You'll be goaded throughout The Comebacks to think of ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Rudy,"" ""Hoosiers,"" ""Field of Dreams"" and their ilk. What you also think about is how much this stuff worked better in ""Airplane!"" or ""Blazing Saddles."" "
1007,The Comebacks,4.2,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Koechner tries hard, but ultimately scores few laughs except for when, like Ferrell, he bares his comically less than toned, fleshy body. "
1008,The Comebacks,4.2,30,Variety," An exceptionally lame genre parody that plumbs depths of ineptitude heretofore charted only by the marginally less abysmal ""Date Movie."" "
1009,The Comebacks,4.2,30,L.A. Weekly," Isn’t as obnoxiously awful as, say, ""Epic Movie""; it’s simply not funny in the least. "
1010,The Comebacks,4.2,30,The New York Times, The movie’s low aspirations are depressing because its best gags are agreeably demented. 
1011,The Comebacks,4.2,25,TV Guide Magazine," We're treated to endless scenes of women getting slammed, thrown and clothes lined, while men's genitals are grabbed, groped, stroked and tasered. It's all just as painful as it sounds. "
1012,The Comebacks,4.2,20,Austin Chronicle," It’s too bad the filmmakers didn’t have a longer view of film history, though; maybe their jokes would have been more interesting if they’d been aimed at, say, ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" or ""The Pride of the Yankees."" "
1013,The Comebacks,4.2,12,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," At the end of The Comebacks, Coach is offered job with a college basketball team called The Sequels - a joke perhaps, but all too horrifying a prospect after watching this dull fumble. "
1014,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,50,USA Today," There's a fun retro camp to Hercules, with nods to classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as Hercules finds himself rowing slave ships and crossing desert expanses. "
1015,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,40,New York Magazine (Vulture)," Like so many of today’s action films, The Legend of Hercules is too busy peddling slick, stone-faced portent to ever bother making us laugh, or engaging us in any way. "
1016,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,39,Film.com," While the art of action filmmaking depreciates, Harlin remains steadfast in his classicism, even if the movie doesn’t have the foundation to support him. "
1017,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," At times, with its stiff, charisma-impaired cast, its digital sets and slo-mo slaughter, The Legend of Hercules has a whiff of the Augean Stables about it — if you catch my drift. "
1018,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,38,Slant Magazine," Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins. "
1019,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,38,RogerEbert.com," While Lutz might possess the beefcake to fill out his chest armor, he lacks the acting chops to make us much care about the fate of his gleaming hero who looks as if he just stepped out of a Beverly Hills salon. "
1020,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,30,Variety," Lutz’s acting muscles aren’t nearly as well developed as his pectorals and deltoids, and while the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he’s straining to execute a dead lift. "
1021,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,20,The Hollywood Reporter," If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top, it might have been ridiculous fun. As it is, unfortunately, Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face, draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities. "
1022,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,20,The Dissolve," Where 300 made a virtue of its low budget by stripping the visuals down to their essential elements, the shot-in-Bulgaria Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly. "
1023,The Legend of Hercules,4.2,16,The Playlist, A movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head. 
1024,Marmaduke,4.2,50,Chicago Sun-Times," If you like the comic strip, now in its 56th year, maybe you'll like it, maybe not. Marmaduke's personality isn't nearly as engaging as Garfield's. Then again, if personality is what you're in the market for, maybe you shouldn't be considering a lip-synched talking animal comedy in the first place. "
1025,Marmaduke,4.2,50,Movieline, The film’s most impressive feat may be bringing a cartoon character to life while turning actual humans into 2-D cutouts. 
1026,Marmaduke,4.2,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," As doggy movies go, this one gets two paws out of four. "
1027,Marmaduke,4.2,40,Variety," With extended closing credits, Marmaduke clocks in at 88 minutes and feels longer. "
1028,Marmaduke,4.2,38,Orlando Sentinel, A dull but harmless big-screen comedy aimed at the youngest movie goers. 
1029,Marmaduke,4.2,30,The Hollywood Reporter, One thing Marmaduke does have in common with the earlier Disney titles is a blessed scarcity of crass bodily-function gags that often pass as family comedy. 
1030,Marmaduke,4.2,25,St. Louis Post-Dispatch," ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" we owe you an apology. Among talking-dog movies, Marmaduke is the runt of the litter. "
1031,Marmaduke,4.2,25,The A.V. Club," Marmaduke saves its farts for the beginning and end, but the stink carries through the whole movie. "
1032,Marmaduke,4.2,20,Boxoffice Magazine," Very small children may well take a shine to the big, goofy dog and his furry friends, but parents and older siblings will be left squirming in their seats at a bland, predictable blend of bad comedy and sentimentality. "
1033,Marmaduke,4.2,12,Boston Globe, We’ve just been treated like a fire hydrant. 
1034,Area 51,4.2,50,The A.V. Club," Though Peli stages a few fun and creepy effects shots, nothing that happens here couldn’t be surmised from simply reading the film’s title. "
1035,Area 51,4.2,38,RogerEbert.com," To be fair, the slow burn does eventually catch fire and there’s lots of screaming and heavy breathing and dark tunnels and running and what-not. The relatively tense final half-hour is clearly the reason that very smart producer Jason Blum thought this would be a solid follow-up to “Paranormal Activity.” It’s that first hour that is the reason it took six years to (barely) get released. "
1036,Area 51,4.2,30,We Got This Covered," Area 51 is everything that's wrong with not only found footage films, but also weak-minded sci-fi thrillers that think crazed talking heads and fuzzy shadows are scary enough. "
1037,Area 51,4.2,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Tedious, visually unsatisfying, poorly acted and narratively disjointed, Area 51 is a textbook example of directorial sophomore slump. "
1038,The Devil Inside,4.2,58,Entertainment Weekly," While this religio-horror effort does contain some nice scares, and a memorably unnerving turn from Crowley, The Devil Inside's biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends - just as it hits its stride. The result is a found-footage movie whose third act remains missing. "
1039,The Devil Inside,4.2,50,Variety," Despite the palpable air of deja vu that hangs over it like a light fog, The Devil Inside generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario. "
1040,The Devil Inside,4.2,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), All hell breaks loose and it's a heck of a lot of fun to watch. 
1041,The Devil Inside,4.2,40,Boxoffice Magazine, The mother/daughter drama should have played a bigger part in this film as the 87-minute runtime passes quickly and leaves us feeling utterly short-changed. 
1042,The Devil Inside,4.2,40,Movieline," The reality of The Devil Inside is that it's a half-hearted patchwork of ideas blatantly lifted from better films, with characters who have to act increasingly foolish in order to allow the action to go forward and an ending so anticlimactic and abrupt that the audience at the screening I attended erupted in enraged boos as the credits rolled. "
1043,The Devil Inside,4.2,38,Slant Magazine," The film's contradictory and nullifying dilemma of wanting to be both scripted and vérité at once, a plight that affects so much contemporary TV, is temporarily quelled in heated scenes of curse-laden levitation and Linda Blair contortion, which dutifully deliver the scares. "
1044,The Devil Inside,4.2,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Never gets off the ground, trotting out the same predictable twisting heads and psycho-babble without a whiff of originality or discernible visual flair. As a result, the would-be thriller proves as scary and unsettling as a slab of devil's food cake - only considerably less satisfying. "
1045,The Devil Inside,4.2,25,Chicago Tribune," The Devil Inside joins a long, woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures, among them ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the ""Paranormal Activity"" films and certain wedding videos that won't go away. "
1046,The Devil Inside,4.2,20,The New York Times," The scariest thing about The Devil Inside is that a major studio like Paramount Pictures, which is distributing it, may be able to squeeze more profit out of a tedious, tediously exhausted subgenre that was already creatively tapped out when ""The Blair Witch Project"" spooked audiences more than a decade ago. "
1047,The Devil Inside,4.2,0,The A.V. Club," The hilariously convoluted thriller contains all the elements for a wacky parody of exorcism movies, except a sense of humor about itself: The Devil Inside never acknowledges its innate ridiculousness, so the laughs are unintentional. "
1048,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,70,TheWrap," Awash in bold colors, bright patterns and ebullient kids, director Ava DuVernay’s new take on A Wrinkle in Time dazzles its way across time and space even if it doesn’t quite stick the landing. "
1049,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,67,IGN," A Wrinkle in Time is ambitious, hopeful, and imaginative, but it’s also messy, overwrought, and oddly paced. "
1050,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,58,IndieWire," It almost doesn’t matter that the movie is too emotionally prescriptive to have any real power, or too high on imagination to leave any room for wonder; DuVernay evinces such faith in who she is and what she’s doing that “A Wrinkle in Time” remains true to itself even when everything on screen reads false. "
1051,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Only the faintest glimmers of genuine, earned emotion pierce through the layers of intense calculation that encumber Ava DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time. "
1052,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,50,Variety," A Wrinkle in Time is wildly uneven, weirdly suspenseless, and tonally all over the place, relying on wall-to-wall music to supply the missing emotional connection and trowel over huge plot holes. "
1053,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,50,Slant Magazine," The film may involve the instant movement among unfathomable distances and the shattered limits of space and time, but it’s only Storm Reid's character who feels multidimensional. "
1054,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,42,Tampa Bay Times," DuVernay finds herself in the unenviable position of being both the right and wrong person for an important job. A Wrinkle in Time is gratifying for what it is, a step forward for creative women of color, and so disappointing for what it turns out to be. "
1055,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,40,The Guardian," The film is tentative and over-protective, as though it’s terrified that a story empowering kids to help good battle evil could give someone a nightmare. It reduces the whole universe to one girl’s self-esteem. "
1056,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,40,ScreenCrush, It’s honestly a little baffling how so many good choices could produce something so frustrating. 
1057,A Wrinkle in Time,4.2,38,Movie Nation," Which is a big build-up to essentially saying, “This movie’s a stiff.” "
1058,The Gallows,4.2,63,Chicago Tribune," Lofing and Cluff certainly know the found-footage ropes, and the tropes; we'll see if their next project reveals a little more imagination. "
1059,The Gallows,4.2,50,Entertainment Weekly," This is another found-footage movie that, with a little art direction and some actual cinematography, could easily have been a decent little terrorizer. Instead, it comes mostly unglued thanks to its hacky gimmick. "
1060,The Gallows,4.2,40,The Hollywood Reporter, Any film that tries to revive this technique needs a clever story or unusual filmmaking ingenuity to stand out from the crowd. The Gallows has neither. It has enough mild scares to captivate the under-25 crowd. 
1061,The Gallows,4.2,38,Slant Magazine, The film is sstrictly a high-tech spin on one of those Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. 
1062,The Gallows,4.2,35,TheWrap, The Gallows is not without thrills. What it lacks is the thrill of the chase. 
1063,The Gallows,4.2,33,The A.V. Club, Making audiences care about the characters is always a more effective fear-generating strategy than just knocking off a bunch of dimwits in the dark. 
1064,The Gallows,4.2,30,Screen International, The Gallows offers up few new ideas and very few genuine scares. 
1065,The Gallows,4.2,25,Movie Nation," If you’re not laughing at this, early and often, you’re made of sterner stuff than the players they paid to show up for this, but didn’t. "
1066,The Gallows,4.2,20,New York Daily News," Sorry, but this kind of high-school horror was old when Jamie Lee Curtis was young. All the ugly, shaky, night-vision camerawork in the world will not make it seem fresh. Or remotely scary. "
1067,The Gallows,4.2,0,Austin Chronicle, The Gallows offers exactly none of the frisson or pleasure of a found-footage film done right. 
1068,Vice,4.2,50,The A.V. Club," Bad doesn’t have to mean boring. Case in point: Vice, a bargain-bin high-concept sci-fi thriller full of Joel Schumacher-esque canted Steadicam moves, leaden expository dialogue, and cheap fluorescents-glued-to-the-wall sets. "
1069,Vice,4.2,38,Movie Nation," Vice is a low-budget sci-fi thriller that borrows heavily from “Blade Runner” and “Westworld,” and serves as an answer to the question “How much movie can you get when you shoot your $10 million film in Mobile, Alabama? The answer is, quite a lot — with modernist buildings, striking control room sets and the city’s docks serving as a backdrop. "
1070,Vice,4.2,38,Chicago Sun-Times," A loud, dopey chase film filled with substandard shootouts. "
1071,Vice,4.2,33,Entertainment Weekly," Everything about Vice feels like recycled goods. It's basically ""Westworld"" meets ""Blade Runner"" programmed by glitchy filmmaking replicators. "
1072,Vice,4.2,30,Village Voice," The film unspools with a momentum that mitigates its artless brutality, kinda, but it's a high-pressure firehose of stupid. "
1073,Vice,4.2,20,The Dissolve," Perversely low-budget and oddly devoid of imagination, Vice seems less like a proper film than a bargain-basement SyFy pilot, shot on the cheap and drafting off Willis and Jane’s star power. It’s about androids aching to be real, but it doesn’t have an ounce of genuine humanity in its tin heart. "
1074,Vice,4.2,12,Slant Magazine, Vice takes the basic premise from 1973's Westworld and morphs it into an incoherent slog. 
1075,Vice,4.2,0,The Playlist," Dull and lifeless, Vice fails on the promise of even its lowest ambitions. "
1076,Vice,4.2,0,New York Daily News," Here’s hoping Bruce Willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless, brutally ugly rehash of 1973’s “Westworld.” "
1077,Vice,4.2,0,The New York Times," Evidencing more bullets than brains, Vice — a bit of ephemeral science-fiction twaddle directed by Brian A. Miller — has absolutely nothing to recommend it. "
1078,V/H/S Viral,4.2,70,We Got This Covered," Grab on for dear life and expect a freakish, wild, and seriously f#cked up ride from start to finish - which, of course, is every horror fan's dream. "
1079,V/H/S Viral,4.2,50,Variety," While the scares are in short supply, there’s a surfeit of macabre, tongue-in-cheek creativity to be found here. "
1080,V/H/S Viral,4.2,42,Consequence of Sound," Although it’s by far the weakest of the three, there are some genuinely creative moments that spark the brain and fry the hairs. "
1081,V/H/S Viral,4.2,42,The Film Stage," Overall, this is easily the weakest of the three V/H/S anthologies thus far, particularly due to its connecting thread. "
1082,V/H/S Viral,4.2,40,Village Voice, Each propulsive segment features a handful of disturbing sequences... But such pleasures barely compensate for the vapidity of V/H/S: Viral's sketches. 
1083,V/H/S Viral,4.2,40,The Hollywood Reporter, Getting four mediocre horror efforts for the price of one doesn't exactly represent a significant bargain. 
1084,V/H/S Viral,4.2,38,Slant Magazine, One need go no further than the film's first segment to grasp how little interest the latest entry in the anthology series has in generating chills from the lo-fi. 
1085,V/H/S Viral,4.2,33,The A.V. Club," A sequel so slapdash and ineffectual that its army of directors — six of them total, counting the poor sucker whose contribution got axed — might well be accused of intentionally burying the franchise. More charitably, perhaps they were trying to put a nail in the coffin of all found-footage horror. Some good must come from this much bad. "
1086,V/H/S Viral,4.2,30,The Dissolve," It feels like the series has run its course, and should be relegated to the dustbin of history alongside the hardware it so lovingly pays tribute to. "
1087,V/H/S Viral,4.2,25,RogerEbert.com," There was little reason to expect such a horrendous drop in quality as there is to “Viral,” a film that contains some of the sloppiest, most ineffective filmmaking I’ve seen all year. "
1088,Grease 2,4.3,80,Washington Post," ""Grease 2"" is the most serendipitous sequel in recent memory. It is an ingratiating, jubilant improvement on a crummy original. "
1089,Grease 2,4.3,70,Variety," Where this film has a decided edge on its predecessor is in the staging and cutting of the musical sequences. Choreographer and director Patricia Birch has come up with some unusual settings (a bowling alley, a bomb shelter) for some of the scenes, and employs some sharp montage to give most of the songs and dances a fair amount of punch. "
1090,Grease 2,4.3,70,Chicago Reader," Light years ahead of Randal Kleiser's 1978 original, this 1982 sequel employs the Shakespearean marriage plot so beloved of classic musicals, in which two mismatched couples are straightened out and the songs express the moral distinctions of love and sex. "
1091,Grease 2,4.3,70,Newsweek," Birch's confidence as a director ebbs and flows throughout -it's odd that she can direct the complicated musical numbers so well and bungle the action scenes so badly. Yet in the end it's hard to resist the movie's bubble-gum romanticism. There's even a dream sequence in which the heroine sings to a vision of her fantasy boyfriend, who appears in heaven in a silver-lame biker's outfit. What can-you say in the face of such sublime silliness but hooray for Hollywood? [14 June 1982, p.88] "
1092,Grease 2,4.3,60,Empire," Definitely of the so-bad-it's-almost-good genre, this kinda stands the test of time in a camp way, mainly because of the charm of Pfeiffer and Carrington. "
1093,Grease 2,4.3,60,Time Out," Such niceties as a plausible plot and three-dimensional characters are trampled under Weejun-shod foot, but sheer energy, a handful of good tunes (including a great theme song from the Four Tops), and some very funny one-liners save the day. "
1094,Grease 2,4.3,50,Chicago Sun-Times," This movie just recycles ""Grease,"" without the stars, without the energy, without the freshness and without the grease. "
1095,Grease 2,4.3,50,TV Guide Magazine," Most conspicuously absent is John Travolta, replaced here by Maxwell Caulfield, who can't lift the original greaser's comb. Michelle Pfeiffer (MARRIED TO THE MOB; DANGEROUS LIAISONS) fares better as Olivia Newton-John's replacement, but the whole movie looks as if it has been slapped together to capitalize on its predecessor's success, and no doubt, it was. "
1096,Grease 2,4.3,38,Slant Magazine," The sequel to Grease is not much more than a remake, wherein every minute detail is nothing more than an attempt to pilfer the magic of the first film. "
1097,Grease 2,4.3,30,The New York Times," Less a sequel than a retread...Dizzy and slight, with an even more negligible plot than its predecessor had. This time the story can't even masquerade as an excuse for stringing the songs together. "
1098,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,40,Variety," Director Peter Bonerz and writer Stephen J. Curwick (the latter taking his second Academy shift) both cut their teeth on TV sitcoms, and it shows. Rarely has a film cried out so desperately for a laughtrack. "
1099,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,40,The New York Times," There are some witty moments, as when the straight man, Proctor, played as usual by Lance Kinsey, uses a squeaky rubber squeegie to wash a window while his partner, Harris (G. W. Bailey), holds a stethoscope to the window to eavesdrop on a conversation taking place on the other side. But most of what takes place in Police Academy 6, from the flying billiard balls to the exploding cigars, are things you have seen someplace before. [3 March 1989, p.1-17] "
1100,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,25,USA Today," Except there are all these dumb pranks even a third-grade schoolboy would be too embarrassed to commit - putting glue on chairs, making silly faces and stupid noises, setting off fireworks at the precinct house. [13 March 1989, p.5D] "
1101,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,20,Empire," This is probably worse than you’d expect, even from a sequel to a sequel to a sequel to a sequel to a sequel. "
1102,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,20,TV Guide Magazine," On the plus side, POLICE ACADEMY 6 is skillfully photographed by Charles Rosher, Jr., and has a very good soundtrack, supplied by Robert Folk. Unfortunately, high production values are wasted on films this slow-paced and silly. "
1103,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,20,Time Out," Surely the nadir of the rehash genre, a string of unconnected party pieces by a cast whose world weariness would imply that they know exactly how cynical this whole venture has become. "
1104,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,20,Washington Post," In Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, the humor (kind word, that one) vacillates between the soporific and the moronic. "
1105,Police Academy 6: City Under Siege,4.3,0,Los Angeles Times," This is comedy so insidious it could scarcely be less than diabolically inspired; to know these 84 minutes is to know an endless living death. [14 March 1989, p.C6] "
1106,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,50,TV Guide Magazine," Though many characters are dispatched in various gory ways, the film gives them more to do than the have-sex-and-die victims of past entries. Director Adam Marcus and writers Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely give them some personality, and the acting is also generally better than in the previous Fridays. "
1107,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,50,San Francisco Chronicle," After a promising opening, with Jason on a rampage and a cold, peculiar bounty hunter (Steven Williams) on Jason's trail, Jason Goes to Hell switches focus midway to the young couple, and from there things go downhill. Still, the film has its moments. [14 Aug 1993, p.F1] "
1108,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,25,Washington Post," The scriptwriters try to conjure some history/mythology to validate the plot's twists and turns, but the whole thing ends up more confusing than Days of Our Lives on fast-forward. "
1109,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,25,The Seattle Times," One might have hoped for some semblance of vitality and ingenuity in this, Jason's ninth and final solo killing spree, but it's a retread to its rotten core. [14 Aug 1993, p.C3] "
1110,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,25,Miami Herald," It's as stupid, unimaginative and cheesy as the rest of them. [16 Aug 1993, p.C2] "
1111,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,20,The New York Times, A largely incoherent movie that generates little suspense and relies for the majority of its thrills on close-up gore. 
1112,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,20,Los Angeles Times," On the movie's feeble plus side are Richard Gant's acting (as the coroner), Manfredini's music and one funny joke in the last half-minute. On the minus side: ludicrous characters. Garbled nonstop gore. Persistent loud, clanging noises that give you the impression of being trapped inside a malfunctioning radiator. Shadowy lighting that makes you feel as if you're staggering around in the dark. [16 Aug 1993, p.F3] "
1113,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,12,Chicago Sun-Times," Not that anyone expected logic, but no one expected the series to so completely abandon much of what was familiar to the audience and become an amalgam of countless other horror-fantasies and pop culture media. [16 Aug 1993, p.24] "
1114,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,10,Variety," Jason goes to hell, and not a moment too soon. His descent has been far too long in coming, as the exhausted, witless Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday demonstrates. "
1115,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,4.3,0,Entertainment Weekly," While the Nightmare on Elm Street movies possess a sick yet clever surrealism, and the first Halloween was at least well crafted, the Friday the 13th series has always been the cut-rate horror franchise, offering barely functional sex-and-slash pitched straight at the moron brigade. Jason Goes to Hell varies the formula a bit, with ideas swiped from The Terminator, The Hidden, and Alien, but after nine installments the impalements and dismemberments all look the same. So go to hell already, Jason — and take Sean Cunningham, the ”brains” behind this dreck, with you. "
1116,Thunderbirds,4.3,70,The Hollywood Reporter," Smartly written by William Osborne and Michael McCullers, Thunderbirds expertly targets kids. Yet parents won't be entirely bored. "
1117,Thunderbirds,4.3,70,Dallas Observer, This special-effects-crammed action blockbuster is not rocket science. It's more like rocket fun. 
1118,Thunderbirds,4.3,63,Chicago Tribune," It's a pretty entertaining, extremely good-looking cinematic blip--not important, not outstanding, but better than a lot of PG stuff that attempts to reach both parents and their 8-year-old kids. "
1119,Thunderbirds,4.3,58,Entertainment Weekly, Without fail its upbeat cheesy wholesomeness is always good for a smile. 
1120,Thunderbirds,4.3,50,Variety," The story rarely gets fired up to ""maximum thrust,"" to use the rocket-speed parlance of its heroes. "
1121,Thunderbirds,4.3,50,Miami Herald," Kids are most likely to be entertained by this live-action offering, although baby-boomer fans of the series will appreciate how closely it hews to the show's foundation. "
1122,Thunderbirds,4.3,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," It's clean and cheerful entertainment, blithely piggybacking on a beloved classic. No wonder Anderson washed his hands of this project - the filmmakers tampered with and trampled on his magic formula. "
1123,Thunderbirds,4.3,40,L.A. Weekly," Thunderbirds is devoted to the principle that character and story are but rude interruptions to the real order of business, an endless display of profound vehicle fetish. "
1124,Thunderbirds,4.3,38,ReelViews," Watching a misfire like Thunderbirds illustrates how impressive the ""Spy Kids"" movies are. "
1125,Thunderbirds,4.3,30,Village Voice," As the dapper Lady Penelope, Sophia Myles tries to infuse the enterprise with some ""Charlie's Angels"" verve, but she's only one life vest, and the movie is a downed plane. "
1126,Zoom,4.3,50,New York Daily News," If August has turned the children in your life into Bored Girl and Fidget Boy, you could find worse ways to keep them entertained. "
1127,Zoom,4.3,38,Boston Globe, Pure Saturday matinee kiddie fodder and this close to going straight to DVD. 
1128,Zoom,4.3,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), A family-friendly adventure. 
1129,Zoom,4.3,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Zoom is a movie that would make Dr. Frankenstein proud. Put together with parts from so many other movies, the thing positively clanks. "
1130,Zoom,4.3,30,Variety, This tepid comic-bookish comedy should zip through its theatrical run faster than a speeding bullet. It likely won't perform much more superheroically in ancillary venues. 
1131,Zoom,4.3,30,L.A. Weekly," Tim Allen gamely brings some humanity to the role of the retired, powerless hero Captain Zoom, but is thwarted at every turn by bad special effects, slapdash editing, interminable pop-song montages, and a goofy performance by Courteney Cox. "
1132,Zoom,4.3,30,The New York Times, Bleeds boredom from every frame. 
1133,Zoom,4.3,25,TV Guide Magazine," One of the most dismal excuses for family entertainment ever perpetrated by a major studio, this crude, lazy variation on Disney's ""Sky High"" (2005) revolves around the education of four ""special"" youngsters at the hands of a washed-up superhero. "
1134,Zoom,4.3,25,San Francisco Chronicle," Zoom is a C-list production in every possible way, from the actors and the special effects to the music and the script. Even the product placement is completely third rate. "
1135,Zoom,4.3,12,New York Post, A kid comedy that's been zapped by extraterrestrial suckiness rays. 
1136,Fat Albert,4.3,60,Dallas Observer," The film is sweet and often genuinely funny, with lively musical numbers and a cast of entertaining personalities. "
1137,Fat Albert,4.3,60,L.A. Weekly, A spirited re-creation of the series that once ruled Saturday mornings. 
1138,Fat Albert,4.3,50,The Hollywood Reporter, An awkward blend of live action and animation. 
1139,Fat Albert,4.3,50,Village Voice," The animated scenes conjure aromas of the stilted ""Clifford,"" and the overall approach is to throw preordained movie sequences (rap number, shopping spree) together and hope for the best. "
1140,Fat Albert,4.3,50,Miami Herald," Kenan Thompson may not look the part, but he's instantly likeable as Fat Albert. "
1141,Fat Albert,4.3,50,Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Fat Albert's originality is lost on the big screen. 
1142,Fat Albert,4.3,40,The A.V. Club," While endearing as cartoons, they don't wear flesh well. "
1143,Fat Albert,4.3,40,Variety," fFat-footed and ham-handed in its attempt to reconstitute a popular '70s TV cartoon show as a full-length, family-skewing feature. "
1144,Fat Albert,4.3,38,Philadelphia Inquirer," Alas, this eternally sunny character's mantra, ""I don't have a problem, I solve problems,"" makes for paltry dramatic tension. "
1145,Fat Albert,4.3,30,TV Guide Magazine," Basic knowledge of the original series is mandatory, but the more familiar you are, the more glaring this movie's considerable deficiencies will seem. "
1146,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,67,Entertainment Weekly," Basic Instinct 2 isn't bad, exactly, but it lacks the entertaining vulgarity of the first film; it's Basic Instinct redone with more ''class'' and less thrust. "
1147,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,50,Variety, Those hoping for either a sizzling -- or an unintentionally hilarious -- good time will be disappointed by this inexplicably dull sequel. 
1148,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,40,L.A. Weekly," Basic Instinct 2 pushes diligently along in a murder-and-mayhem-stuffed effort to demonstrate that (a) a sillier and more hackneyed movie than ""Basic Instinct"" is possible and (b) that shrinks have ids too, by golly. "
1149,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,38,Chicago Tribune," Once the credits are done rolling it's a dour, enervated mystery, selling the old cat-and-mouse games. "
1150,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,30,Washington Post," Where is the suspense part? There is no suspense part. Suspense demands clarity of motive and action, and this screenplay never provides it. "
1151,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,30,Wall Street Journal," Basic Instinct 2 is pretty awful. Rarely has a meaningless thriller had so many meaningful glances, or such arch acting by good actors who know better. "
1152,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,25,The A.V. Club," Fortunately, as a showcase for Sharon Stone's physique, Basic Instinct 2 is a rousing success. In every other respect, it's a colossal failure. "
1153,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,10,The New York Times, A disaster of the highest or perhaps lowest order. 
1154,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,0,Austin Chronicle," Stone still dazzles the eye, but this wholly unwarranted sequel is so outrageously preposterous (and so very chockablock with quotable examples of the fine art of bad dialogue) that the end result achieves a basement grandeur of near-epic proportions. "
1155,Basic Instinct 2,4.3,0,Rolling Stone," The laughs to be had in this deliciously awful sequel are all unintentional. A bummer for film buffs, but a ball for fans of the misbegotten. "
1156,Cell,4.3,60,Screen International, This apocalyptic thriller is a run-of-the-mill zombie flick that goes through the genre motions efficiently enough but fails to live up to its credits. 
1157,Cell,4.3,58,Entertainment Weekly," While it’s nice to see Cusack and costar Samuel L. Jackson downplay rather than go big, Cell has a been-there-done-that quality that winds up feeling a bit disappointing. "
1158,Cell,4.3,50,The A.V. Club," Directed by Tod Williams (Paranormal Activity 2) and co-scripted by King himself, it brings a best seller to the big screen with a minimum of spectacle, a maximum of affordable Georgia locations, and a couple of names to splash prominently across the Amazon rental thumbnail. "
1159,Cell,4.3,42,IndieWire, This is the undead equivalent of fast food. Some might find comfort in all these known quantities. Those looking for anything of substance would do better to wait for an upgrade. 
1160,Cell,4.3,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Though it's better than its ""dump this thing"" theatrical release would suggest, Cell is far from excellent. "
1161,Cell,4.3,40,Los Angeles Times," King worked on the script for Cell, which isn’t that surprising given that many of the worst adaptations of his work have his name on them. It only proves how hard a job it is to adapt King. Even the author himself can’t ace it. "
1162,Cell,4.3,38,Slant Magazine," The film insufficiently connects the book's prophecy with its present-day, real-world forms of realization. "
1163,Cell,4.3,38,New York Post," For John Cusack in Cell, the bad news is that his phone just ran out of juice. The good news, sort of, is that those who are on their phones were just attacked by a piercing signal that turned them into flesh-munching zombies. "
1164,Cell,4.3,33,Consequence of Sound," Given the absurdity of the premise, Cell isn’t nearly as luridly entertaining as it should be. "
1165,Cell,4.3,30,Village Voice, King's decision to co-write the script and turn it into a CliffsNotes version of The Stand only makes things worse. 
1166,College Road Trip,4.3,63,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), You know a movie has taken a very strange turn when you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next appearance by Donny Osmond. 
1167,College Road Trip,4.3,58,Entertainment Weekly," At its best when it drops any pretense of plot for sheer goof (as when a Japanese sightseer belts ''Sister Christian'' on a karaoke tour bus), and at its worst when Lawrence manages to out-ham even his porky four-legged costar. "
1168,College Road Trip,4.3,50,Variety," This overplayed, underachieving laffer feels thoroughly manufactured to Disney specifications. "
1169,College Road Trip,4.3,40,L.A. Weekly," Lawrence's descent from hyperactive foulmouth to G-rated father figure has been in evidence for years now, but watching director Roger Kumble move from flawed but juicy projects like ""Cruel Intentions"" to pap like this is a depressing career development. "
1170,College Road Trip,4.3,40,Washington Post," Perhaps there will be people who do laugh at Lawrence and Raven-Symon screaming in tandem, or mugging their way along every tortured mile of their road trip, or unwittingly joining a sky-diving club and having to parachute into Washington so Melanie can make her interview. Heck, it was all really funny when they did it on ""I Love Lucy."" "
1171,College Road Trip,4.3,40,The Hollywood Reporter, What is puzzling is the incompatibility of the two leads with their roles. Raven is supposed to be a high school senior on a road trip to check out prospective universities. But she acts like a adolescent on a sugar high during a weekend sleepover. 
1172,College Road Trip,4.3,40,The New York Times," Eyes popping and mouths agape, Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symoné mug their way through College Road Trip as if it were a silent movie -- which, come to think of it, would have been a lot less irritating. "
1173,College Road Trip,4.3,38,Chicago Tribune," As generic as its title, College Road Trip feels like a first draft, the one the studio brings to the rewrite team that, in this case, never got hired. "
1174,College Road Trip,4.3,25,TV Guide Magazine," Lawrence runs through his usual repertory of mugging, seething and generally acting like a fool, only to be regularly upstaged by Arnold, Trey's pet piglet. "
1175,College Road Trip,4.3,25,USA Today," The tagline for College Road Trip is ""You Can't Get There Fast Enough."" But for those who sit through this humorless and massively predictable movie, a more apt phrase would be: ""You Can't Get Out of There Fast Enough."" "
1176,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,50,Boxoffice Magazine," So it's a half-certainty, half-shock that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is both good and bad, a sequel that's hungry for thrills but bereft of the cohesiveness - and budget - to be a full meal. "
1177,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,50,Village Voice," Cage-ophiles will find some delectable freakouts in Blaze's transformation - or near transformation - scenes. Otherwise, the committee-penned script combines yokel-friendly haw-haw irreverence (non-sequitur cutaways to the Rider pissing in a flamethrower pattern) and sweaty monologues about ""controlling the Rider"" (the character is basically a mean drunk's superhero). "
1178,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,50,New York Magazine (Vulture)," Spirit of Vengeance is so focused and, as a result, so impoverished that you actually feel bad for Cage. The actor tries to bring the weird (though at this point one wonders if he can even do anything else) but the film more often than not leaves him high and dry, saddling him with standard-issue action hero lines and boilerplate action set-pieces. "
1179,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,50,Movieline," The smugness of the film grows wearying long before the end. Just because the people on and behind the camera are willing to acknowledge what we're watching is ridiculous crap doesn't really change the fact that, well, it is. "
1180,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,50,Tampa Bay Times," Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance offers Cage plenty of opportunities to tap his inner circus geek, to twitch, cackle and flail without shame, going full tilt batwing crazy. Not since he danced in a pagan bear suit in The Wicker Man has Cage appeared this unconcerned about what the audience will think. "
1181,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,40,Empire," Like ""Ghost Rider: Low Voltage,"" this is a surprisingly underpowered excursion into Marvel's mad world by Neveldine and Taylor. More purgatory than hellfire. "
1182,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,40,The Hollywood Reporter," A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there. "
1183,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,33,Entertainment Weekly," Most of the movie's action-horror set pieces play like lame Gwar music video outtakes, and Cage's signature mix of irony and off-the-rails mugging only works when you can see the actor's face. In Ghost Rider form, his character is just a skeletal automaton with neither a tongue nor a cheek to put it in. "
1184,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,25,New York Post, The only part of this movie anyone's ever going to remember is the pair of scenes in which Ghost Rider pees flame. 
1185,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,0,Rolling Stone, One look at the dreadful mess that is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance will turn your whisper into a primal Cage scream: MAKE THIS MOVIE STOP! 
1186,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,70,Variety," A faster, funnier follow-up in which CGI-enhanced canines and felines effect a temporary truce to combat a common enemy. "
1187,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,60,Arizona Republic," A clever, funny movie that will entertain kids and adults. "
1188,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,50,The Hollywood Reporter, This isn't so much that the story and characters are weak -- though they very much are -- but that animatronics and computer animation so anthropomorphize these critters that they bear more resemblance to cartoons than actual flesh-and-fur animals. 
1189,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,42,Tampa Bay Times," The movie is geared to preschoolers, so only parents dragged with them may complain. There's only that Looney Tunes overture to savor before the Acme production begins. "
1190,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,38,Orlando Sentinel, Tedious time-killer of a kiddie comedy. 
1191,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,30,Austin Chronicle," Although it's great fun for the under-8 set and for those of us monitoring the chaos theory that is Nolte's career of late, this film is otherwise mediocre and features some of the most uninvolving 3-D CGI since ""Clash of the Titans"" earlier this year. "
1192,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,30,L.A. Weekly, About as unremarkable as a film about talking animals organized into competing intelligence agencies can be. 
1193,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,25,Entertainment Weekly, No movie -- whether aimed at adults or kids or canines themselves -- has the right to be as tiresome and unoriginal as this action-comedy mutt. 
1194,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,20,Boxoffice Magazine," Fails to deliver enough clever gags, emotional warmth, or eye-popping 3D to compete with recent family releases. "
1195,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,0,The A.V. Club," And it's still, in the spirit of the original film, an unbelievable piece of sh--. "
1196,Movie 43,4.3,58,Entertainment Weekly," At its best, Movie 43 resembles a risqué episode of Saturday Night Live - a comparison reinforced by the presence of both parody ads and Jason Sudeikis. At its worst? Let's just say that Hugh Jackman fans who want to remember the actor as Jean Valjean and not as a guy with a scrotum sprouting from his neck should make alternate plans this weekend. "
1197,Movie 43,4.3,50,The Playlist," An oddity recommended for only the most fervent, undemanding comedy junkies. "
1198,Movie 43,4.3,30,The New York Times," The kindest thing to be said of Movie 43, a star-saturated collection of crude one-joke vignettes made with big-time directors, is that most of the participants seem to relish being naughty. "
1199,Movie 43,4.3,20,Total Film," Quite why A-listers Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman and Emma Stone (among others) aligned themselves with this excruciatingly moronic compilation of shorts is anybody's guess. "
1200,Movie 43,4.3,20,Empire, Just no. 
1201,Movie 43,4.3,20,Time Out," As sick-making sketch comedies go, this stupefyingly bad one-somehow rife with A-list talent-must rank near the very bottom. "
1202,Movie 43,4.3,16,The A.V. Club," The sketches aren't united by a half-ignored framing device, so much as by an enduring fascination with bodily functions. Movie 43 is the most star-studded collection of jokes involving menstruation, flatulence, incest, bestiality, Snooki, and nutsacks ever assembled, but the stars don't elevate the material-they just descend to its level. "
1203,Movie 43,4.3,0,The Hollywood Reporter," Despite the dizzying array of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, this godawful exercise is so painfully unfunny, so screamingly bad that it immediately qualifies as one of the worst films of all time. "
1204,Movie 43,4.3,0,New York Post," If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous ""Howard the Duck,'' ""Gigli,'' ""Ishtar'' and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing Movie 43. "
1205,Movie 43,4.3,0,Slant Magazine," This is barely a movie at all, mostly due to its structural similarities to ""SNL"", but also because it acknowledges the fact that its own premises are inherently unfilmable. "
1206,Fantastic Four,4.3,50,Variety," Ultimately, Fox’s stab at reviving one of its inherited Marvel properties feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran — not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn’t gel. "
1207,Fantastic Four,4.3,49,TheWrap," Director Josh Trank, whose debut feature “Chronicle” put a smart new spin on superhero tropes, has assembled a quartet of engaging, charismatic performers and stranded them in a miasma of exposition and set-up that sinks the movie. "
1208,Fantastic Four,4.3,40,Time Out London," This reboot of the Marvel superhero franchise is a film of two halves: the first likeable and fun, the second tiresome and loud. "
1209,Fantastic Four,4.3,40,The Guardian," The cast are some of the most promising actors of their generation, but what chemistry there is between them is swept away by wave after wave of expository dialogue and ludicrous exclamation. "
1210,Fantastic Four,4.3,40,Total Film," Ponderous, pretentious and, most damning of all, just not much fun. "
1211,Fantastic Four,4.3,40,Empire," As an origin story that’s all origins and no story, there’s a hollow, stale feeling to this occasionally admirable attempt to Nolanise Marvel’s dysfunctional family. "
1212,Fantastic Four,4.3,30,Screen International, A good cast led by Miles Teller gets swallowed up in a narrative that grows progressively more muddled and tedious. 
1213,Fantastic Four,4.3,25,The Playlist," In turning his back on the familiar tropes of blockbuster comic book movies, Trank doesn't have a clear new identity for Fantastic Four to distinguish itself with, and the result is a movie rich with possibilities, but trapped in the basic structure of a superhero movie, with no idea of how to wholly circumvent traditional expectations. "
1214,Fantastic Four,4.3,25,Miami Herald," Fantastic Four is so bereft of all the things we expect from a superhero movie — humor, excitement, adventure, awe — that it plays like a drawn-out pilot episode for an upcoming TV series no one would ever watch again. "
1215,Fantastic Four,4.3,20,The Hollywood Reporter," A sense of heaviness, gloom and complete disappointment settles in during the second half, as the mundane set-up results in no dramatic or sensory dividends whatsoever. "
1216,Yoga Hosers,4.3,70,New York Magazine (Vulture)," Yoga Hosers is the best film Kevin Smith has made in a long time, which admittedly isn’t saying much. But this new cult comedy-thriller may well represent a turning point for the writer-director. "
1217,Yoga Hosers,4.3,50,The Film Stage," Yoga Hosers isn’t a bad time at the movies, but it’s painful when the gags fall flat. "
1218,Yoga Hosers,4.3,40,Screen International, Yoga Hosers is a movie that feels like it was more fun to make than to watch. 
1219,Yoga Hosers,4.3,33,Consequence of Sound," While Yoga Hosers continues Smith’s quest to push himself into increasingly strange and uncomfortable directions as a filmmaker, it’s either too derivative or too malformed to work the vast majority of the time. "
1220,Yoga Hosers,4.3,33,The Playlist," Kevin Smith's Yoga Hosers is a flabby, goofy, comically inert cartoon. "
1221,Yoga Hosers,4.3,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Even fans who've stuck with Smith for two decades may draw the line at this outing, which offers ingredients just as inexplicable as those in Tusk (it's a sort of spinoff of that film) without the captivating weirdness that sometimes brought that midnighter to life. "
1222,Yoga Hosers,4.3,25,Slant Magazine, Any of the film's attempts at moralizing are subsumed by Kevin Smith’s obsession with taking aim at his critics. 
1223,Yoga Hosers,4.3,20,The Guardian, [A] lazy affair that aims for inspired lunacy but misses the mark by a mile. 
1224,Yoga Hosers,4.3,20,Variety," If it’s true, as Kevin Smith noted in his lengthy introductory remarks at Sundance, that “failure is just success training,” then he should be in the best shape of his career after Yoga Hosers, an imbecilic, strenuously wacky helping of see-what-sticks juvenilia. "
1225,Yoga Hosers,4.3,20,Village Voice," Yoga Hosers is lazy, unfunny, and self-indulgent. "
1226,Exposed,4.3,60,Time Out London," Asking far more questions than it could ever answer, Exposed ends on a note so flat and predictable that it undermines all that went before. But there are strange and memorable moments here, and a mood of eerie foreboding that’s hard to shake. "
1227,Exposed,4.3,30,The New York Times," In certain mutilated pictures, you can detect the lineaments of greatness: Consider Orson Welles’s “The Magnificent Ambersons.” Here, that’s not the case. "
1228,Exposed,4.3,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Exposed mainly serves to expose the often torturous process of moviemaking and distribution. 
1229,Exposed,4.3,16,The A.V. Club," If it’s any consolation to the parties involved, Exposed could have ended up being worse; however, it’s unlikely that it could have been much better. Trainwreck-bad movie enthusiasts will be disappointed to find a film largely defined by its lack of energy, in which every scene seems to be stalling for time. "
1230,Exposed,4.3,10,Los Angeles Times, It’s hard to imagine how anything salvageable could have been made out of [Gee Malik Linton's] comically pretentious script with its heavily religious overtones and plotting that grows more ridiculous by the minute. 
1231,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,83,IndieWire," Led by a few strong performances, and delivering plenty of heart-clutching moments, The Bye Bye Man is sure to appeal to horror lovers of all stripes. "
1232,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,60,The Hollywood Reporter," Title deploys a fairly effective range of horror techniques, including jump scares, misdirection and some oddly unattractive VFX to ratchet up the tension, although gore is at a minimum. "
1233,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,50,Variety," Even when it seems to be making things up as it goes along, its slapdash hallucinatory quality is a token gesture toward placing you inside the characters’ heads. "
1234,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,40,Austin Chronicle," The borderline campy The Bye Bye Man is a horror movie in search of an urban legend. Based on a chapter in the 2005 collection of allegedly strange-but-true paranormal tales ""The President’s Vampire,"" the premise is second-rate Stephen King. "
1235,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,40,Arizona Republic," What we’re left with are a few PG-13 murders, uninspired performances, some not-so-scary urban legends and a couple of actresses who must be wondering how they got here. "
1236,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,38,Boston Globe, The concept is derivative of about a dozen other movies and their sequels. 
1237,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,38,Movie Nation," The Bye Bye Man is a moldy slice of Wisconsin-set cheese, a horror film that manages as many unwanted laughs as frights. "
1238,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,30,TheWrap," Title’s command of the material is haphazard, her direction not artful enough to know when expository clunkiness is undercutting the chance to dig into the meat of personalities in deterioration. "
1239,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,25,The Playlist," The Bye Bye Man just skirts so-bad-it’s-good territory, unintentionally making the audience laugh more than they gasp. "
1240,The Bye Bye Man,4.3,20,We Got This Covered," The Bye Bye Man is an unfathomably inept horror film; one that’s an obvious byproduct of The Babadook/It Follows brand of horror success. It is, without apology, one of the emptiest, nonsensical haunted thrillers ever to fail genre audiences. "
1241,Supergirl,4.4,80,Washington Post," It is a wonderfully wacko work, sparked with Cook's oomph, Dunaway's cackle and the superstar power of the sensational Slater. What a face! As long as people prevail over effects, Supergirl glitters, she glows. [23 Nov 1984, p.27] "
1242,Supergirl,4.4,70,Washington Post," Director Jeannot Szwarc could have done more with the action scenes, but he has a snappy sense of pace and comic timing. Blond, blue-eyed Slater brings an engaging sweetness to Supergirl; and she plays Linda with an awkward, gawky girlishness, subtly different from her Supergirl role. "
1243,Supergirl,4.4,60,Variety," Helen Slater is a find: blonde as Supergirl, dark-haired as Linda Lee, she’s an appealing young heroine in either guise. Screenplay is filled with witty lines and enjoyable characters, but Jeannot Szwarc’s direction is rather flat. "
1244,Supergirl,4.4,60,Time Out, Most delightful of the Super-series for its good-natured disregard of narrative considerations. 
1245,Supergirl,4.4,50,Chicago Sun-Times," The gift of Christopher Reeve, in his best scenes and when the filmmakers allow it, is to play Superman without laughing, to take him seriously so that we can have some innocent escapist fun. Helen Slater has the same gift, but is given even less chance to exercise it in Supergirl, and the result is an unhappy, unfunny, unexciting movie. "
1246,Supergirl,4.4,50,The New York Times," Supergirl arouses some initial curiosity about the differences between the two cousins; for instance, that Supergirl can't change in phone booths and is much the better flier of the two. However the film, as directed by Jeannot Szwarc and written by David Odell, quickly loses its novelty. "
1247,Supergirl,4.4,50,Miami Herald," Supergirl was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, whose previous big credit was Jaws II. The two films have something in common beyond their status as sequels to successful originals; both have a curiously flat, almost stale feel about them. And both are as disposable as Supertissue. [21 Nov 1984, p.C1] "
1248,Supergirl,4.4,30,The A.V. Club," Slater not only makes for a dull Supergirl, but she's stuck in a clumsy, silly film that tries for the light touch of Richard Lester's Superman II and fails decisively. "
1249,Supergirl,4.4,25,TV Guide Magazine," Jeannot Szwarc's direction is flat and uninspired, emphasizing the jokey elements without any sense at all for the material. "
1250,Supergirl,4.4,25,Chicago Reader," Queasily suspended between drag theatrics (Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro camping it up on a soundstage replica of a carnival spook house) and Spielbergian wholesomeness (Canadian Helen Slater as a toothy, Aryan Ubermadchen), this is one comic-book feature that doesn't fly. "
1251,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,60,Empire," Lame, but in a good way. "
1252,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,50,Los Angeles Times," Highlander: The Final Dimension is elementary and vague, but this purportedly last installment works well enough on a comic book level. Music video veteran Andy Morahan, in his feature directorial debut, has the right idea: Go for as much energy, pace and visual panache as possible. [30 Jan 1995, p.F8] "
1253,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,40,Time Out," Lambert is as uncharismatic as ever, while Van Peebles is as frightening as a wrestler in mock angry mood, and just as ridiculous. To Morahan's credit, however, he smoothly continues the series' tradition of flashy images, showy sfx, aerial landscape shots and driving rock tunes. "
1254,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,25,TV Guide Magazine," Although Christopher Lambert repeats his film role as the immortal action hero, he is less dynamic than he was in Highlander or even Highlander 2, The Quickening. He is also far less charismatic and interesting to watch than Adrian Paul of the European television serial. Moreover, in this film, Lambert inexplicably whispers his lines, while the special effects are deafening. "
1255,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,25,Washington Post, Those immortals keep noting that there can be only one. Perhaps they mean there should have been only one. 
1256,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,25,San Francisco Chronicle, Highlander: The Final Dimension is no more compelling than the average pile of bricks. 
1257,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,25,Philadelphia Inquirer," Highlander: The Final Dimension is exactly what it seems - drivel. [30 Jan 1995, p.D01] "
1258,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,20,The New York Times, An incoherent mess. 
1259,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,20,Variety," An unbelievably trashy meltdown of the tartan warrior franchise, Highlander III checks in as a breakneck, roller-coaster genre ride that’s brainless fodder for undiscriminating auds. "
1260,Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,20,Austin Chronicle," Highlander 3 has an edge over its prequels in that it's so shoddily directed that it's probably a great deal of fun to watch after a couple of six-packs. Actually, that's probably the only time it might be fun to watch, and I'm not going to be the guy to put that theory to the test for you. "
1261,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,50,Variety," Leisurely and overly familiar pic should appeal to young teen girls, but won't be breaking any B.O. bricks with its bare hands. "
1262,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,50,Baltimore Sun, This film feels like a desperate attempt to squeeze a few last bucks out of what was once a very obliging cash cow. 
1263,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,50,Washington Post," The fourth film in the series, the newest installment has a new director, Chris Cain, and a female Kid, Hilary Swank, but otherwise it reprises the formula established by John G. Avildsen in 1984: A troubled teen conquers self-doubt and the local bullies with the help of an enigmatic karate teacher. "
1264,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,50,Los Angeles Times," If this installment is just slightly less laborious than Karate Kid II or III, it's not from Mark Lee's surprise-free script or Christopher Cain's placid direction, but because young Swank really might be a find. Early on, she's such a convincingly testy teen that parents may flinch, but she does seem to blossom before your eyes. "
1265,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,50,TV Guide Magazine," Overlong and utterly predictable, The Next Karate Kid offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence. "
1266,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,42,Entertainment Weekly," Clearly, three sequels haven’t improved Miyagi’s English, but there is something bitchin’ about seeing a babe give a bully a good thwack. Not that girls will go see this or boys will care. "
1267,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,40,Empire, Almost a guilty pleasure. But not quite. 
1268,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,40,Austin Chronicle," There's really nothing new here (as if anyone expected there would be), but it's a decent enough entry into the Karate Kid series, if you don't mind having seen it all done before, and better. "
1269,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,38,The Seattle Times," The Next Karate Kid is harmless as children's entertainment, but for 104 very long minutes, there isn't a recognizable human being in sight. "
1270,The Next Karate Kid,4.4,25,Chicago Tribune, It should be obvious to anyone at this point in time that Kid is getting a little long in the tooth. As Miyagi might say: Those who keep milking same idea . . . end up killing cash cow. 
1271,Bio-Dome,4.4,42,Entertainment Weekly," Even with the low expectations any reasonable viewer brings to a Shore flick, this rates only stupid-plus. The bongs-and-pajamas set, though, should be riveted. "
1272,Bio-Dome,4.4,20,TV Guide Magazine," A potentially amusing comic premise -- dropping a pair of anarchic stoners into the spaced-out, sanctimonious world of New Age bio-dome enthusiasts -- gets submerged in a shower of witless gags and the feeble one-joke persona of MTV celebrity Pauly Shore. "
1273,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,The New York Times," Thoroughly incoherent... A dreary fizzle. [12 Jan 1996, p.C12] "
1274,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,San Francisco Chronicle," Shore possesses only two talents -- his ability to assume yoga-like positions and fondle his own behind, and his mystifying knack for getting starring roles in bad movies. "
1275,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,Christian Science Monitor," Pauly Shore is less a comedian than a class clown, and his dim-witted mugging makes Jim Carrey's antics seem creative triumphs by comparison. Vapid, vulgar, and more to the point, not funny. "
1276,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,Washington Post," A nonstop moronathon... Bio-Dome offers a pants-load of poop and masturbation jokes, deviant innuendo and simian sight gags destined to gross out and offend just about everyone. "
1277,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,San Francisco Examiner, This film may set an all-time record for shortest time between the big screen and your local video store. 
1278,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,Variety," Neither the script nor direction lives up to the concept, and the picture evolves into a ""Bio""-degradable hash rather than a zany sendup of potent issues and serious intents gone awry. "
1279,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,Los Angeles Times, [Shore] seems convinced that the antics of his retarded persona amount to some manner of postmodernist anti-comedy and this makes the resultant boredom seem all the more pathetic. 
1280,Bio-Dome,4.4,0,The New Yorker," The sheer ineptitude of the movie is supposed to be funny, but there's no lunacy behind it: Shore and his writers are like comedians on Prozac, smiling through the fart jokes without a hint of desperation. "
1281,Species II,4.4,40,Chicago Reader," Most of this is silly, dim-witted stuff, but a few of the shocks carry some of the crude power of Jack Arnold's low-budget horror films of the 50s. "
1282,Species II,4.4,38,ReelViews, The only thing that distinguishes Species 2 is how awful it is. 
1283,Species II,4.4,33,Entertainment Weekly," ""Species"" at least had the benefit of Henstridge's glazed porn-doll perversity, but this time any glimmers of sexual ominousness are buried in a lame, desultory chase plot and in the woefully underimagined special effects. "
1284,Species II,4.4,30,The A.V. Club," Though it never really taps into the whole JFK-as-alien-sex-fiend plot as a source of satire, Species 2 is still the superior piece of trash its predecessor should have been. "
1285,Species II,4.4,25,Christian Science Monitor, What ensues is a Halloween-style blood bath accompanied by graphic sex scenes. 
1286,Species II,4.4,20,Austin Chronicle," Shoddily plotted and unimaginative, Species II is a slapdash effort at best, creepily unaffecting and minus the T&A this sort of film so desperately hinges on. "
1287,Species II,4.4,20,Empire," Though Species II is far from serious and aimed squarely at the hairy-palmed, it really didn't need to be quite this rotten. "
1288,Species II,4.4,20,Los Angeles Times," The best advice to give anyone who wants to see Species II--other than ""don't go!""--is ""don't eat!"" "
1289,Species II,4.4,20,The New York Times," In the spring a monster's fancy lethally turns to thoughts of lust. This thought, reduced to a level contemptuous of taste and reasonable intelligence, underlies Species II. "
1290,Species II,4.4,0,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Brain-melting, head-spinning rank toxicity that shows no evidence of intelligence as we know it. "
1291,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,75,Chicago Sun-Times," Eight different characters, all played by Murphy, all convincing, each with its own personality. This is not just a stunt. It is some kind of brilliance. "
1292,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,60,Salon," This is a parlor trick, but it's a hell of a good one. "
1293,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Murphy is remarkably convincing -- even endearing -- as each of the characters. 
1294,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,50,New York Daily News, It's just like Paul McCartney's first solo album after the Beatles broke up; he played all the instruments himself -- because he could. 
1295,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,30,Austin Chronicle," Sporadically funny, the film seems weighted down, literally, with bulging, bulbous Murphys flatulating endlessly. "
1296,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,30,TV Guide Magazine, An amazing technical accomplishment that never becomes a coherent movie. 
1297,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,25,Portland Oregonian," An annoying, unclever, unlikable movie. "
1298,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,20,Chicago Reader, Wastes most of its 110 minutes making impotent jokes about male sexual behavior and the repugnance of old women. 
1299,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,20,Newsweek, What was a ragged but often hilarious charmer has been genetically altered into a deafening and desperate mutant. 
1300,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,4.4,10,Dallas Observer, It will linger like a foul odor or the taste of tinfoil between the teeth. 
1301,Jason X,4.4,80,New Times (L.A.)," A happily self-aware body-count flick that's as brutally funny as it is plain-old brutal. A broad slash of scary, sci-fi fun, the project leapfrogs all the Scream and Last Summer junk to carve itself a new, high-tech niche. "
1302,Jason X,4.4,50,L.A. Weekly," The film has spunk. Unfortunately, the gore comes with brutal regularity, so that, despite Farmer and Isaac's attempts to liven things up, the film still just wears you down. "
1303,Jason X,4.4,50,San Francisco Chronicle, The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable. 
1304,Jason X,4.4,40,Salon, It gets much more watchable in the last half-hour. 
1305,Jason X,4.4,38,USA Today, A moviegoer's only defense against Jason is to avoid theaters showing this gruesome and derivative movie. 
1306,Jason X,4.4,38,New York Post," There's a hint of nostalgia toward the end, with Jason encountering two nubile female campers in a virtual reality Camp Crystal Lake -- but it merely serves as a reminder that the franchise should have quit while it was ahead. "
1307,Jason X,4.4,25,ReelViews," Too much of Jason X plays it straight, and that means boredom. Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous. "
1308,Jason X,4.4,20,TV Guide Magazine," Despite the futuristic setting, which relies so heavily on GGI effects that it looks like a feature-length production concept painting, this film is painfully predictable. "
1309,Jason X,4.4,20,Film Threat," The kind of a moron movie, which is built to be watched by people who haven’t even seen the other nine. "
1310,Jason X,4.4,12,Boston Globe," The only chills to be found are courtesy of your theater's central air, and the suspense will come from the wait to see which disappointed kid in a hockey mask will be the first to slash the screen. "
1311,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,50,USA Today, Jumps at chance to be silly. 
1312,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,40,Chicago Reader, Likable but negligible. 
1313,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,38,New York Post," A dumb, by-the-numbers children's movie. "
1314,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,25,Rolling Stone," The 'roo doesn't talk, except in a dream sequence…I'm dying here. "
1315,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," In the life-is-too-short category, file Kangaroo Jack as a sub-Farrelly Brothers, dumb-plus-dumber buddy picture. "
1316,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,11,Austin Chronicle," Indeed, the largely computer-generated Jack acts the pants off his co-stars, which can and should be taken with a whole trough full of salt. "
1317,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,10,The A.V. Club," Straight from the fiery, churning bowels of high-concept hell comes Kangaroo Jack, Bruckheimer's idea of kid-friendly fare, and some of the longest 90 minutes ever committed to film. "
1318,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,10,The New York Times," What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture? "
1319,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,10,Dallas Observer," Were it not for the involvement of producer Bruckheimer, who has made billions by conning millions into believing they can't live without his celluloid crack, it's doubtful Kangaroo Jack would even exist. As it stands now, the ""movie"" barely exists anyway. "
1320,Kangaroo Jack,4.4,0,New York Daily News, It's fitting that the kangaroo gives the most lifelike performance. 
1321,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,70,L.A. Weekly, What's fun is that the road to that climactic Capitol showdown is paved with one ridiculous and relentlessly edited set piece after another. 
1322,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,70,The Hollywood Reporter," A smooth blend of visual special effects, exceptional stunts, fluid photography, sharp design and a possible best-selling soundtrack. "
1323,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,50,Christian Science Monitor," Most of the movie is standard action fare, but the political commentary is interesting when it's allowed to surface. "
1324,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,50,Miami Herald," Basically the first movie all over again, with plenty more of the bridge-jumping, rocket-launching action that audiences loved about the original. "
1325,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,50,Variety," You'd half expect the Xbox logo to pop up on the credit roll for XXX: State of the Union, since what's on view is closer to a videogame than a movie. While that will be music to the ears of young gamers, it's noise to anyone hoping for a coherent action movie. "
1326,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,38,Chicago Tribune," What isn't scary--or exciting, amusing or fun--is XXX: State of the Union, a movie so preposterous, cliché-packed and over the top that it makes the original ""XXX"" seem as good as the original ""State of the Union."" "
1327,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,38,ReelViews," One can give Ice Cube props for attitude, but not much more. "
1328,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,38,Charlotte Observer, The special effects excite at first but wear out their welcome. 
1329,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,30,Washington Post," Loud, dumb and obnoxious. "
1330,xXx: State of the Union,4.4,12,Philadelphia Inquirer, Appalling sequel. 
1331,Ultraviolet,4.4,40,L.A. Weekly," For this violent yet gore-free film, clearly designed for horny teenaged video game wizards, writer-director Kurt Wimmer stages a succession of fight sequences that pit V against helmeted thugs who appear to have raided the Star Wars storm trooper costume closet. "
1332,Ultraviolet,4.4,38,Premiere," Amid every action cliche in the book, outmoded stereotypes, and a plot derivative of every futuristic drama made in the last fifteen years, Ultraviolet comes off as nothing more than a pale copy of better, more inventive films. "
1333,Ultraviolet,4.4,30,The New York Times, Mr. Wimmer is more concerned with fetishizing his heroine and patronizing his audience. The verdict? Ultrasilly. 
1334,Ultraviolet,4.4,30,Chicago Reader," Director Kurt Wimmer has an eye for jackboot chic (Equilibrium), and the images here have been digitally polished so that the characters' skin is smoother than porcelain. It's a cool effect--I spent most of this interminable actioner wondering if one could bounce a quarter off Jovovich's bare midriff. "
1335,Ultraviolet,4.4,25,New York Daily News," Ultraviolet, unscreened for critics, is unfit for consumption. "
1336,Ultraviolet,4.4,25,TV Guide Magazine," An all-but-incoherent mess whose main components are palpably fake-looking CGI effects, video-game-style action sequences and Milla Jovovich's admirably taut abdomen, Kurt Wimmer's film epitomizes just about everything wrong with post-MATRIX, comic book-/video-game-inspired, Hong Kong-action-style sci-fi thrillers. "
1337,Ultraviolet,4.4,25,Boston Globe," Jovovich is bad, and not in a good way. She turns in an epically expressionless performance (maybe she thought it was one of her modeling gigs?) but she sure looks great. "
1338,Ultraviolet,4.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," The latest entry in the ""This film is so bad we're not screening it for critics"" genre. "
1339,Ultraviolet,4.4,20,Variety," Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film. "
1340,Ultraviolet,4.4,0,New York Post," A cut-rate ripoff of ""Aeon Flux"" with Milla Jovovich as a butt-kicking futuristic heroine in a midriff-baring bodysuit, is ultrastupid, ultra-incoherent, ultrasilly - and way, way ultraboring. "
1341,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,75,Entertainment Weekly," The star (Allen), unleashed, is so energetic in his approximation of a bearded collie -- his nose sniffing the air, his whole being (which toggles between human and canine form) overcome by the need to fetch any stick thrown -- that his slobbery charm carries the picture. "
1342,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,70,The Hollywood Reporter, A fast-moving Walt Disney Co. comedy that manages to sail past many of the cliches usually found in this genre while throwing together a wild story line more apt for a new millennium. 
1343,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,70,The New York Times, Ms. Curtin is one of several examples of quirky casting that make this Shaggy Dog much more fun than it might have been. 
1344,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,50,L.A. Weekly," In this serviceable remake of the fondly remembered 1959 Disney comedy (which starred Fred MacMurray), an impressively dexterous Tim Allen plays Dave Douglas. "
1345,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,50,Austin Chronicle," There are precious few surprises here, but parents will find director Robbins' breezy remake a painless affair and, judging by the yowls of laughter from the peanut gallery at the screening I attended, the kids will be barking all the way home. "
1346,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,50,Chicago Sun-Times," It says something for Robert Downey Jr. that in a movie where a man becomes a dog, Downey creates the weirdest character. "
1347,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,50,Los Angeles Times, Strictly for the very young who will find giggles in the anthropomorphic mash-ups and won't be too distracted by the predictably mawkish sitcom plot. 
1348,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,40,Variety, This fur-fetched tale is bearable family viewing. 
1349,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,33,The A.V. Club," Okay, so when does the fun start? "
1350,The Shaggy Dog,4.4,30,Washington Post," As a comic actor, Allen's palette is limited to varying degrees of beige. He is not only boring, he's obnoxious and narcissistic. Where's the ASPCA -- the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences -- when you need 'em? "
1351,Little Man,4.4,63,USA Today," Almost in spite of itself, Little Man manages to deliver big laughs. It's not enough to make it a consistently funny movie, but this one-trick pony from the Wayans brothers has flashes of humor and sincerity that almost save it from its disastrous ending. "
1352,Little Man,4.4,40,L.A. Weekly," There's no question, though, that the Wayanses have dialed down the outrageousness to nearly sub-PG-13 levels. "
1353,Little Man,4.4,40,Chicago Reader," The slapstick is funnier for the nifty CGI, and the script gets in some sly digs at racist cops and multitasking soccer moms. "
1354,Little Man,4.4,38,Chicago Tribune," I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh at some of this--though it's not as funny as Laurel and Hardy as toddlers in ""Brats."" But I wanted to slap myself whenever I did. "
1355,Little Man,4.4,38,Premiere," Little Man only proves that some should just stick to the sketch comedy, and leave the big screen to ""Big Daddys"" like Adam Sandler who the critics tend to snub, but who know how to make an audience laugh. "
1356,Little Man,4.4,33,The A.V. Club," It's seldom a good sign when a Rob Schneider cameo elevates a comedy, but Little Man aims so low and fires so often that it can't miss all the time. "
1357,Little Man,4.4,33,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Yes, in this day and age, a tall man can pretend to be a very short man pretending to be a baby who uses his innocent disguise to molest women and whack men in the nuts. Isn't that funny? No, actually, not so much. "
1358,Little Man,4.4,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Once the initial round of breast-feeding and rectal thermometer bits is fired off, the picture starts to give off the funky whiff of unattended Pampers. "
1359,Little Man,4.4,30,Variety," There are probably some moviegoers who can laugh at the sight of a groin-punching, breast-grabbing baby, possibly even find it cute. Everyone else should steer clear of Little Man, which welds Marlon Wayans' head to a diminutive body double, offering up the creepiest bigscreen dwarf since the last David Lynch movie. "
1360,Little Man,4.4,20,The New York Times," Somewhere within all the crude slapstick and crass stereotypes, Little Man operates as a vulgar burlesque on the crisis of African-American manhood, particularly the relationships, or lack thereof, between fathers and sons. "
1361,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,75,Philadelphia Inquirer, Handles the strained daddy/daughter bond with sufficient lightness and laughs so that fathers won't mind accompanying their spawn. 
1362,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,70,Variety, A goofily endearing romp that might even lasso a few new fans. 
1363,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,63,Premiere," If you are a big fan of country music, you will enjoy it for the Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Billy Ray Cyrus and of course, Miley Cyrus performances. "
1364,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,60,The Hollywood Reporter," There are sufficient pratfalls and Miley/Hannah quick-changes to satisfy the fans, while Cyrus retains that natural, unforced likability that made her a star in the first place. "
1365,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,60,New York Daily News," Like 2003's ""Lizzie McGuire"" movie, ""Hannah"" breaks little new ground but makes the big screen shift with liveliness and sense of humor impressively intact. "
1366,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,60,Los Angeles Times," In the end, Hannah Montana: The Movie is big, beautiful, a little boring and utterly safe. There are flashes of inspiration -- the ""Hoedown Throwdown"" dance, the scenes between Martindale and the Cyruses -- but it also is what it is: Miley Cyrus' next big step. "
1367,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,50,L.A. Weekly, It's almost foolish to review Hannah Montana: The Movie as anything other than the latest cog in a cultural phenomenon/mass-marketing juggernaut. The film itself certainly doesn't aspire to anything more. 
1368,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,50,Chicago Tribune," I like the end-credits sequence best, which has nothing to do with hoary complications or the miseries of stardom or the magical spellbinding powers of a cheap wig. "
1369,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,50,Boston Globe," Miley may vacillate, but for now her indentured servitude to Disney continues. The image that comes to mind is Princess Leia chained to Jabba the Hutt, but that's probably just me. "
1370,Hannah Montana: The Movie,4.4,50,The A.V. Club, The only folks Montana is interested in pleasing are prepubescent girls and Disney stockholders. 
1371,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,63,Chicago Tribune," If the movie is a mess, it's a purposeful mess, cannily, if not artfully, pushing all the right buttons to ensure Perry will be back for another round. "
1372,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,60,New York Daily News," Though he plays two other roles, Perry only really cuts loose when he dons Madea's housecoat, turning her into a devilishly funny voice of reason. Likewise, the movie tenses up when she's offscreen, becoming the sort of moralistic soap opera we've seen from Perry before. "
1373,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,58,The A.V. Club," Madea's physical comedy is loud enough to wake the dead, but its drama is just as excessive. In a neat bit of economy, Perry stages a wedding that doubles as a breakup, and triples as the villain's crowd-pleasing comeuppance. Now that is some serious multitasking. "
1374,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,Entertainment Weekly," It's a tale soggy with the kind of race/class lessons that Madea, the director-star's battle-ax alter ego, doles out far more handily (and entertainingly) in a single church-lady-from-hell zinger. "
1375,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,Variety," Wildly uneven effort, which is notably more strained and slapdash than such earlier efforts as ""Madea's Family Reunion"" and ""Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns."" "
1376,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,Boston Globe," There is, however, Viola Davis, who might win an Oscar tomorrow for her one scene in ""Doubt."" Her part here - a minister combing the street for crack-whores to rescue - is about three times as large. "
1377,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,Salon," It's great that Perry has seized opportunity for himself and for the performers he employs. But has he succeeded only in creating a kind of ghetto for black-themed entertainment that's of sub-par quality -- one that, admittedly, makes him a lot of money? "
1378,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,The Hollywood Reporter," For all its staleness, the melodramatic main story does contain enough good acting and resonant scenes. "
1379,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,The New York Times," There is something both satisfying and frustrating about Madea Goes to Jail. Mr. Perry dutifully gives his audience what it wants, but you can't help feeling that he might also have more to offer: more coherent narratives, smoother direction, better movies. "
1380,Madea Goes to Jail,4.4,50,L.A. Weekly," Check off all of Perry’s motifs: vilification of the black bourgie princess, tough-love Christian messages, Academy Award–nominated actresses (Viola Davis, this time) managing to maintain their dignity. "
1381,Sex and the City 2,4.4,70,The Hollywood Reporter," So even if Sex and the City 2 consisted of nothing but a two-hour fashion show, it would draw crowds. But it also has the returning cast members in fine comic form, and it has more cutting-edge humor than the first movie. "
1382,Sex and the City 2,4.4,50,Variety," Part of the action occurs in the desert, which inadvertently proves apt, since the oases of enjoyable moments -- and they do exist -- suffer from being spaced too widely in what's otherwise a long, arid trek. "
1383,Sex and the City 2,4.4,50,Orlando Sentinel," If “the gals” have to bow out, at least they try to do it in a sprint -- in their Manolo Blahniks. It’s a pity nobody told them you can’t run in heels -- in sand dunes. "
1384,Sex and the City 2,4.4,50,Boxoffice Magazine," The ""Fab Four's"" dramadies continue for the audiences who love them. Trouble is the surrounding story and its supposedly fun sojourns are as embarrassing as granny panties. "
1385,Sex and the City 2,4.4,40,Arizona Republic," Sex and the City 2 isn't a feature film as much as it is consumer porn. The audience is not asked to relate to the characters, or at least what we remember of them, as much as to their shoes, their bags, their apartments, their couture, their stuff. "
1386,Sex and the City 2,4.4,40,New York Daily News," It's over the top, and over the rainbow. But just like Carrie's worries about the ""sparkle"" leaving her marriage, this movie is like once-brilliant Champagne, carelessly left out overnight. And gone flat. "
1387,Sex and the City 2,4.4,40,Time Out, One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another. 
1388,Sex and the City 2,4.4,38,USA Today," An insult to the memory of the cleverly written show and its celebration of friendship, it's a slap in the face for the four gal pals (often photographed at unflattering angles) and an affront to Muslims. "
1389,Sex and the City 2,4.4,30,New York Magazine (Vulture), The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film. 
1390,Sex and the City 2,4.4,30,Village Voice," Like its predecessor, SATC2--with a script that's basically a sack full of not very funny gag-lines wrapped in strung-together episodic mini-scenes--is not suited to be a movie. "
1391,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,60,Movieline, It goes down like a canned but genial '80s comedy: Without fanfare or much nutrition; part of your balanced breakfast. 
1392,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,50,Variety," Kind of a drag when it resorts to frantic slapstick and tired action-comedy tropes, but modestly engaging during stretches that suggest the project would have worked better as an exuberant musical. "
1393,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,40,The Hollywood Reporter, Won't likely disappoint fans of men-in-drag comedy but doesn't offer much that's original or funny. 
1394,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,40,Village Voice, John Whitesell's extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichés. 
1395,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,33,Entertainment Weekly," Lawrence's gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow. "
1396,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,25,Orlando Sentinel," A humorless mashup of ""White Chicks"" and ""Glee."" "
1397,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,25,Boston Globe," Fresh or not, creatively merited or not, here it comes: the third installment of Martin Lawrence's big, dopey franchise. "
1398,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,20,Empire, Whoever demanded a third installment of Lawrence's mirthless mash-up of weak gags and cross-dressing horrors should be imprisoned and forced to watch it on repeat until they repent. Avoid. 
1399,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,10,Boxoffice Magazine," Starved of humor and energy, the interminable Big Mommas: Life Father, Like Son could force Lawrence and co-star Brandon T. Jackson undercover for real. "
1400,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,10,Los Angeles Times, A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact. 
1401,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,83,Entertainment Weekly," Unlike its obvious influence, the 1999 Japanese shocker ""Audition,"" The Human Centipede has no real-world echoes. It's an only-in-the-movies sick goof. "
1402,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,80,Village Voice," Centipede plays on the notion that the only thing more frightening than death is a state bridging life and death, in which, though one's body is no longer his own to control, the mind remains conscious. "
1403,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,75,New York Post," Dieter Laser is grand as the doc, a character Christopher Walken would be comfortable doing, and Akihiro Kitamura provides laughs as the first part of the centipede. "
1404,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,50,Boxoffice Magazine," More of a stunt than a script, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) should get a modest amount of I-dare-you ticket sales, but it's about as mass market as a dogfight. "
1405,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,50,Rolling Stone, The only way to react is by bringing a barf bag or a strong sense of gallows humor. 
1406,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,20,Variety," Only real payoff is seeing the monstrosity assembled, and though that will surely earn the Dutch writer-director a cult reputation on the genre circuit, ""going there"" does not a movie make. "
1407,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,20,Time Out, Excruciatingly stupid movie. 
1408,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,12,Chicago Sun-Times," Six has now made a film deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage. It's being booked as a midnight movie, and is it ever. Boozy fanboys will treat it like a thrill ride. "
1409,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,0,New York Magazine (Vulture), The movie stinks to heaven. 
1410,The Human Centipede (First Sequence),4.4,0,The Hollywood Reporter, Crosses the line from horror to just plain sick. 
1411,Skyline,4.4,60,Empire," Technically ambitious, dramatically basic. Still, it's a major step up from an AvP sequel and delivers all the Saturday night whizz-bang and Sunday morning brain-ripping you could want. "
1412,Skyline,4.4,50,Boxoffice Magazine, This sci-fi thriller manages to blend genuine suspense with unintentional laughs. 
1413,Skyline,4.4,38,Chicago Tribune," Their (The Brothers Strause) effects are pretty good, on a fairly limited budget. And that's about all you can say for Skyline. "
1414,Skyline,4.4,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Beyond the dazzling ""first contact"" sequences seen in the trailers, Skyline is a spasmodic and incoherent shambles hampered by an astoundingly stupid screenplay. "
1415,Skyline,4.4,25,Boston Globe, The Strauses don't care about how to keep an audience. Their movie has no sense of suspense or dread - Skyline is an apocalypse movie that plods like one of Romero's zombies. 
1416,Skyline,4.4,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," So intent are the Strausses on showing off their visual chops, they leave the film's story, dialogue and acting in shambles. "
1417,Skyline,4.4,25,Orlando Sentinel," Skyline plays like an effects guru's resume reel, not a movie. "
1418,Skyline,4.4,20,Movieline," Skyline is a piece of junk, even in a movie climate littered with expensive - though sometimes fun - junkiness. "
1419,Skyline,4.4,20,New York Daily News, It's finally here: The most boring alien-invasion movie ever. 
1420,Skyline,4.4,12,ReelViews, Just plain bad. Boring. Unwatchable. 
1421,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,60,New York Daily News," Either the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies are getting better, or I've accidentally buried my brain for the winter. The third entry in the franchise - Chip-Wrecked - is, dare I say, the charm. "
1422,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,60,Arizona Republic," The sequel's target audience may be too young to realize that the best punch lines are long past their expiration date, but at least they're learning the idea of the catchphrase. They can hear the exclamation points. "
1423,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,42,Entertainment Weekly," Good news: The shrill CG rodents, who last infested theaters in 2009's Squeakquel, are stranded on a jungle island with little hope of survival. Bad news: They've brought us along. "
1424,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,40,Movieline, Number of chipmunks who speak fluent chola when necessary: three. Number of Spider-Man/Pepe Le Pew mash-ups I can't really get into: one. 
1425,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,33,The A.V. Club," With its wall-to-wall pop covers, Chipwrecked isn't a kids' movie so much as a brightly animated, instantly forgettable animated feature-length advertisement for the NOW That's What I Call Music! compilation series of contemporary pop hits. "
1426,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,25,Boston Globe," Whatever character they bring to their lines, the actors' voices are mostly unrecognizable after being digitally 'munk-ified. "
1427,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Every bit as frantic, frenetic, groan-inducing and all around grating as its two predecessors. "
1428,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,20,Boxoffice Magazine," Chipwrecked is the sort of Sunday afternoon trifle that will mollify children and mortify their parents, an eyesore that auto-tunes its strong cast into anonymity and undercuts its convincingly rendered CG leads by confining them to hideously cheap environments. "
1429,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,12,Slant Magazine," It's that rare thing, a movie that clocks in under 90 minutes, but feels like an endurance test in every moment, at every plot concern, and every musical number. "
1430,Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,4.4,0,Austin Chronicle," I really think the entire payoff to the Chipmunks' gambit comes in those inevitable moments when Dave bellows in exasperation, ""Alvin."" Maybe if we all bellow in unison it will be forceful enough to put an end to this painful film franchise. "
1431,The Darkness,4.4,42,The A.V. Club," It’s vaguely endearing to watch Bacon and Mitchell actually try to act their way through the film’s family drama, as though it weren’t a perfunctory pretext to jump scares. The Darkness needs their chops. It needs anything to distract horror fans from the fact that there’s nothing new here. "
1432,The Darkness,4.4,40,Los Angeles Times," While McLean and company admirably aim for some relevance by tying the Taylors’ haunting to their personal demons, ultimately The Darkness is just the same old show: things that go bump in the night, and the tasteful decor they defile. "
1433,The Darkness,4.4,40,New York Daily News," The Darkness offers very few new scares, mainly because it's so haunted by the ghosts of far better horror movies. "
1434,The Darkness,4.4,40,The Guardian," Bacon, Mitchell and especially young Lucy Fry are all quite effective in these dramatic scenes. But this isn’t a drama. It’s a dumbass, inexpensive horror flick which means anything real is thrown away so that poorly rendered CG ghosts can hover about and smash up windows. "
1435,The Darkness,4.4,38,Movie Nation," The scariest thing about The Darkness turns out to be the trailers to this summer’s more promising horror offerings, “Lights Out” and “Don’t Breathe.” "
1436,The Darkness,4.4,30,Variety," At some point in the production process, co-writer/director Greg McLean must have believed he was making John Cassavetes’ “Poltergeist,” but this odd fusion of psychodrama and supernatural hokum gets away from him. "
1437,The Darkness,4.4,30,Austin Chronicle," It’s like being haunted by outsized chimney sweeps that never bathe. And for the most part, it’s about that scary. "
1438,The Darkness,4.4,25,RogerEbert.com," The Darkness is pretty much a total bust—it isn’t scary, it isn’t exciting and it plods along at such a snails pace that even though it clocks in at just over 90 minutes, it plays like it runs at least twice that. "
1439,The Darkness,4.4,25,Slant Magazine, This enterprise is so listless that one can't even work up a proper head of self-righteous steam over the spooky Native American clichés that drive the plot. 
1440,The Darkness,4.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," Amid the rarely very creepy buildup to the Amityville-ish showdown to come, the screenplay piles on more unrelated domestic drama than the picture can take. "
1441,Getaway,4.4,42,The A.V. Club," For the most part, Getaway lacks tension and violence. Strobe cuts rob the stunts of any sense of motion; twisting metal, seen in half-second snippets, becomes abstracted texture. While it’s possible to appreciate this stuff on an individual level, it doesn’t quite add up to an action-movie whole. "
1442,Getaway,4.4,40,New York Daily News," What Getaway needed most is enough juice to get to the finish line, narratively speaking. Because while jumping into the car is great, the fun dies fast if there’s nowhere to go. "
1443,Getaway,4.4,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," Maybe they all took a gander at that random, ridiculous scenario and hoped that the car would be cool enough to bail them out. It isn’t. "
1444,Getaway,4.4,30,Variety, Easily one of the dopiest major studio releases since Elie Samaha got out of the business. 
1445,Getaway,4.4,30,Austin Chronicle," This is not a remake of Sam Peckinpah's ""The Getaway,"" but a new effort. The film is loaded with action and violence, although not in any logical or accessible way. "
1446,Getaway,4.4,30,The Dissolve," It couldn’t be a simpler, more workable premise for a good B-movie, but the amount of effort put into making it fast and edgy is inversely proportional to the scant thrills it yields. "
1447,Getaway,4.4,30,Arizona Republic," Gomez plays ... well, that’s one of the problems. Her character is so underdeveloped in director Courtney Solomon’s movie that she doesn’t actually have a name. "
1448,Getaway,4.4,21,Film.com, The film blinks too fast to maintain a coherent vision. 
1449,Getaway,4.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter, Getaway seems built for non-English speaking territories in which dialogue is as disposable as Bulgarian police cars. If only those audiences were as dumb as the action itself. 
1450,Getaway,4.4,0,The Playlist," It's understandable that larger scale movies will want to spawn sequels, but this is about two degrees away from being a movie that premieres on Cinemax on a Friday night, sandwiched between two soft core porn movies with funny titles. Getaway is stuck in neutral. And that's where it'll stay. "
1451,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,42,The A.V. Club," If anything, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 ups that sadness quotient, spending much of its opening proving that just because these movies are stupider than ""Observe And Report"" doesn’t mean they have to be less cripplingly depressing. "
1452,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,40,The Telegraph," It’s not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he’s barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels. As you watch the film, it’s already forgotten. "
1453,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,25,New York Post," Is it never funny? No, it’s not never funny. It’s just not funny nearly often enough. "
1454,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,25,Movie Nation," Sequels are cynical by nature, but this one, with its casino product placement ad and director Andy Fickman apparently checking his text messages instead of trying to punch the limp gags into shape, is purely a paycheck. James may not deserve better, but the kids they’re pitching this to do. "
1455,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,25,Entertainment Weekly, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 does all it was created to do: exist. 
1456,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,20,Time Out London," Given that it comes courtesy of Adam Sandler’s production company Happy Madison... it’s no surprise that Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a lazy, witless, laugh-free experience. But even by their standards, this is a slog to sit through, so glacially paced that at times it achieves an almost zen-like level of anti-comedy. "
1457,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,20,The Hollywood Reporter," While the original was no classic, it had a few mild laughs and the plus-sized actor displayed a certain buffoonish charm. Such is not the case with this painfully unfunny, slapdash follow-up in which the title character is so relentlessly obnoxious that you'll be cheering for the villains. "
1458,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,20,Variety," Nothing aired by WikiLeaks could possibly be more destructive to Sony’s reputation than the release of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, the sort of movie that goes beyond mere mediocrity to offer possible evidence of a civilization in decline. "
1459,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,20,New York Magazine (Vulture)," Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless? "
1460,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,0,New York Daily News," James' everyman appeal is stretched to the limits here, like that polyester shirt he wears. "
1461,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,63,Chicago Sun-Times," While the actors do a yeoman’s job in presenting their characters with aplomb (especially Jesse Metcalfe, as Wesley’s lawyer), the entire film simply comes off as a two-hour, jazzed-up movie version of a sermon. "
1462,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,40,TheWrap," Its pulls back from the original film’s cruelty and comeuppances for non-believers, yet its non-Christian characters are still parodies of human evil: greedy, bitter, violent, and out to prove that “God is dead.” "
1463,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,38,RogerEbert.com," There are serious movies about the Christian faith, about the persecution of the faithful, and about the intolerance that goes both ways. God's Not Dead 2 is not one of them. "
1464,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,38,Movie Nation," In a righteous world, the better-acted, upbeat and faith-affirming “Miracles from Heaven” would eat this angry tirade for lunch. "
1465,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,25,The A.V. Club," The first film pandered to a heavy persecution complex; this installment’s relatively subtler, but there are dog whistles aplenty. "
1466,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,25,Consequence of Sound, There is a tone of anger that sneaks out of the film in even its moments of levity. 
1467,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,20,The Guardian," God’s Not Dead 2 is a much better movie than God’s Not Dead, but that’s a bit like saying a glass of milk left on the table hasn’t curdled and is merely sour. "
1468,God's Not Dead 2,4.4,0,Variety," Dramatically speaking, God’s Not Dead 2 operates at the level of your average middle-school play – except with far greater levels of upside-down logic and bald-faced intolerance for anyone not enraptured by the New Testament. "
1469,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,50,Los Angeles Times," Despite the final escape of star Steve Guttenberg, and the loss, long since, of the original director and writers, this is almost a good movie. It's an incremental, heavily qualified success, but ""PA 5"" is an improvement on the elephantine, witless ""2,"" ""3"" and ""4."" "
1470,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,40,The New York Times," But the formula is pretty long in the tooth by now, and all the extra turns of plot can't disguise that. "
1471,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,30,Variety, Miami field trip only brings a pastel backdrop to the insipid infighting of the boobs in blue. 
1472,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,25,Chicago Tribune," Comedy doesn't have to be refined or original to be entertaining, but it ought to have a little flair. The gags of this ""Academy"" are blunt and literal, delivered without the careful set-ups or rhythms that, in the hands of a Laurel and Hardy, can make physical comedy into its own kind of poetry. [22 Mar 1988, p.C3] "
1473,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,25,Miami Herald," The jokes? Passing gas, large breasts, schoolyard double entendre -- the usual run of recess humor. On the faces of most of the cast, one can clearly read despair, occasionally even irritation. They know: If you're much over 10, Police Academy 5 isn't going to keep you awake. [23 March 1988, p.C7] "
1474,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,20,Empire, Pretty terrible sequel in every respect. 
1475,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,20,TV Guide Magazine," POLICE ACADEMY 5 presents a patchwork of ideas borrowed from a score of wittier and better-done comedies, not to mention earlier entries in the series. In short, it's exactly what you would expect it to be. "
1476,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,20,Time Out, The Apocalypse Now-style Wagnerian soundtrack that accompanies the air boat chase across the Everglades almost raises a smile. Otherwise it's business as usual: fart jokes. 
1477,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,10,Washington Post," Those bumbling boys and girls in blue are back on the streets in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. And they're more moronic than ever -- '80s Keystone Kops dropping their pants, breaking wind and parading their big American ""mangoes."" Nothing is too degrading for these troupers. Gradually the more employable members of the original squad, such as Steve Guttenberg (not that he's so great), have gone on to better assignments. But the desperate have returned to reprise their roles in this fifth-rate rehash of the rather wonderful original. ""5"" is a comic assault, batteries not included, an insufferable collage of coarse slapstick vignettes. "
1478,Police Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach,4.5,0,Chicago Tribune," I didn't laugh once during the entire film-not at the slapstick, not at the humor, all of which is pitched at the preschool level. [25 March 1988, p.A] "
1479,On Deadly Ground,4.5,60,Empire," The fuzzy thinking allows for gorgeous outdoor photography and a few too many dead spots, but Seagal the director shows real muscle by staging one of the screen's best-ever exploding helicopters and allowing Seagal the star to spit out tough talk, as when he refuses to shoot Caine because, ""I don't want to dirty my bullets."" "
1480,On Deadly Ground,4.5,60,Los Angeles Times," Although you could certainly wish that Seagal and his writers, Ed Horowitz and Robin U. Russin, could have found less preachy ways to express themselves, On Deadly Ground is otherwise lively entertainment for action fans. "
1481,On Deadly Ground,4.5,50,ReelViews," It isn't difficult to identify those who will and won't like this film. There's plenty of violence, lots of fights and explosions, and the miniatures special effects work is impressive. A sizable portion of the Seagal crowd will likely be annoyed by the environmental message and the Eskimo religious practices because they interfere with On Deadly Ground's pacing. In the end, however, there's probably enough bang to overcome these flaws for Seagal's fans, if not anyone else. "
1482,On Deadly Ground,4.5,50,Variety," This is a vanity production parading as a social statement. It nonetheless has enough sound, fury and flash to satisfy the action crowd who have propped up Seagal’s career. "
1483,On Deadly Ground,4.5,40,TV Guide Magazine," Loud, stupid and clumsy. "
1484,On Deadly Ground,4.5,40,The New York Times," Mr. Seagal's own film is awesomely incoherent, a mixture of poorly executed violence and Dances With Wolves-style astral musings. "
1485,On Deadly Ground,4.5,38,The Seattle Times," This fuzzily illustrated sermon is mostly an attempt to prove that the internal combustion engine is obsolete, and that oil companies everywhere are conspiring to wipe out alternative methods. "
1486,On Deadly Ground,4.5,30,Washington Post," Martial arts maven Seagal has long been on deadly ground with critics, and this, his directorial debut, is likely to keep him there. "
1487,On Deadly Ground,4.5,0,Austin Chronicle," Certain things must be answered, like Seagal's environmental lip service that is utterly mocked by the movie's need to blow things up and destroy property. "
1488,On Deadly Ground,4.5,0,Entertainment Weekly," What is there to do but laugh in self-defense at such pompous self-regard when blood gushes, fuses pop, and Seagal scowls in a series of snappy, embroidered buckskin jackets? "
1489,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,50,ReelViews, The problem here isn't as much the talent in front of the camera as it is the weak and hackneyed script. Vampire in Brooklyn is in need of an infusion (or should that be transfusion?) of originality and creativity -- two qualities that are blatantly absent. 
1490,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Vampire in Brooklyn is neither funny nor frightening and comes up a tedious middle-road hybrid from veteran scaremeister Wes Craven, who directed. "
1491,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,50,San Francisco Examiner," Vampire is hardly a consequential film, nor does it suggest hitherto buried reserves of Murphy's talent. But it's a diverting mixture of horror, romance and comedy. "
1492,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,50,Boston Globe," Vampire in Brooklyn isn't a disaster. In fact, it has some funny moments. But it's a long way from being the comeback movie Eddie Murphy needs. [27 Oct 1995, p.57] "
1493,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,40,Austin Chronicle," Neither all that scary nor all that hilarious, Vampire in Brooklyn falls directly between the two, into the valley of mediocrity. "
1494,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,25,Chicago Sun-Times," The movie is unpleasant to look at. It's darker than ""Seven,"" but without sufficient purpose, and my overall memory of it is of people screaming in the shadows. To call this a comedy is a sign of optimism; to call it a comeback for Murphy is a sign of blind faith. "
1495,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,25,Chicago Tribune," For years I've criticized Murphy for not working with the best directors or powerful female co-stars. But he does that here, and his movie is still a clunker. Relatives are listed in the credits; maybe he needs to stop trying to completely control the films he makes. Either that or it's time for another stand-up concert film. [27 Oct 1995, p.B] "
1496,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,20,Washington Post," Eddie Murphy plays it straight rather than bawdy in A Vampire in Brooklyn. It takes some getting used to. As if to make up for all this seriousness, he plays a few funny characters in disguise. But despite his omnipresence, he seems comically missing. "
1497,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,20,Washington Post," Murphy has said that he wanted the picture to work both as a comedy and a horror movie, but he has succeeded at neither. Director Craven manages to wedge in some of his signature bits, but can't keep the comic elements in balance with the horror, and as a result there's no tension or dramatic pull. "
1498,Vampire in Brooklyn,4.5,0,The New York Times," Like so many Eddie Murphy misfires, Vampire in Brooklyn has no idea how to capitalize on the actor's immense appeal. The film was directed by the horror master Wes Craven and it turns out to be an Eddie Murphy-Wes Craven movie that is not funny or scary. Now that's a nightmare. "
1499,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,60,The New York Times," The movie's comic heart consists of a series of indescribably loopy, elaborately conceived happenings that are at once rigorous and chaotic, idiotic and brilliant. "
1500,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,50,Chicago Reader, The earnestness of some of the drama in the only deceptively unsophisticated narrative may be more shocking than any of the gross-outs. 
1501,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,25,USA Today, Not since Andy Kaufman's reign of terror has a supposed funnyman been so self-indulgently persistent in testing a fan's patience. 
1502,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,25,Miami Herald, Formidably stupid. 
1503,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,25,New York Daily News, Exhaustingly manic but curiously unfunny movie. 
1504,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,20,Rolling Stone, It feels manufactured to be suitable for mass consumption. 
1505,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,10,Film.com, Do not bring children to this movie unless you want them to have nightmares for weeks. 
1506,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,10,Washington Post," In a sense, this is a horror film, worse than anything Andy Kaufman could dream up, in which Green tries to outgross himself. "
1507,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,0,Austin Chronicle," Green, who looks like a chinless, hollow-eyed pederast at the best of times, is simply out of his league here, and the fact that the film drags interminably when it's actually a very average 90 minutes long betrays its essential emptiness. "
1508,Freddy Got Fingered,4.5,0,Chicago Sun-Times, This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels. 
1509,Baise-moi,4.5,70,L.A. Weekly, A small revolution tucked inside clichés and willful artistic ineptitude. 
1510,Baise-moi,4.5,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Seeks to shock and to outrage, and so far it's done both quite nicely. "
1511,Baise-moi,4.5,50,Rolling Stone," Certainly blunt, and since Anderson and Bach are veterans of the porn trade, there is no skimping on the sex. "
1512,Baise-moi,4.5,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," Strictly for adventurous moviegoers, a peculiar experience -- a polemic that is at once watchable and repellent. "
1513,Baise-moi,4.5,50,Chicago Tribune," Fast-moving shocker, but it's a dull shocker, so morally dead that it deadens you to watch it. After a while you couldn't care less if anyone is slaughtered or raped -- including the heroines. "
1514,Baise-moi,4.5,40,Los Angeles Times," As has happened before in less extreme circumstances, filmmakers with purportedly serious intentions punish their viewers for watching their envelope-pushing depiction of sex on the screen by presenting it in the most profoundly negative context imaginable. "
1515,Baise-moi,4.5,30,Slate, The filmmakers have separated themselves from all the emotions of filmmaking except anger. 
1516,Baise-moi,4.5,20,Salon," Didactic, clumsily directed and abysmally acted, never lets go of its intellectualized approach long enough to deliver any real kinetic thrills. "
1517,Baise-moi,4.5,10,Variety," This hard-core pic is a half-baked, punk-inflected porn odyssey masquerading as a movie worth seeing and talking about. "
1518,Baise-moi,4.5,0,Austin Chronicle, It's pornography of the most depressing sort. 
1519,Taxi,4.5,63,USA Today," A surprisingly funny, female-driven romp — as long as you don't question too many plot particulars. "
1520,Taxi,4.5,38,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), Very little of it works. 
1521,Taxi,4.5,30,Village Voice," Throughout this Americanization of the Luc Besson–scripted French hit, Latifah itches to check her watch, Fallon appears mortified, and only Ann-Margret mainlines any comic adrenalin. "
1522,Taxi,4.5,30,The New York Times," A bland, half-finished film that seems to have been conceived as off-peak cable fodder. "
1523,Taxi,4.5,30,TV Guide Magazine," Queen Latifah is a natural-born charmer, but there's only so much she can do when paired with a costar so irritating it's hard not to squirm when he's on the screen, which is most of the time. "
1524,Taxi,4.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," This thoroughly repetitive, ill-conceived and poorly executed effort -- with an emphasis on the word ""effort"" -- defeats these two talented people more often than not. "
1525,Taxi,4.5,30,Variety, Commits any number of comedic violations during an aimless pursuit of laughs. 
1526,Taxi,4.5,25,New York Daily News," Bad as he is, Fallon cannot claim Taxi's worst moment. That belongs to Ann-Margret. "
1527,Taxi,4.5,25,Baltimore Sun," Taxi's only saving grace is an inexplicable, though delightful, turn by Ann-Margret as Andy's ever-tipsy mom. She's a stitch, and about 100 times better than her surrounding material. "
1528,Taxi,4.5,12,New York Post, This witless action comedy begins to insult the audience's intelligence from the opening scene. 
1529,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,50,Philadelphia Inquirer, Muniz is quite winning as a plucky teen who is constantly being thrown into situations over his head. But the usually reliable Anthony Anderson e-mails in his performance as Cody's handler. 
1530,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,50,Washington Post," Kids should be reasonably diverted for a couple of hours, but odds are they'll have forgotten the whole thing by the next morning. "
1531,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,50,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Try as it might, this glossy action adventure isn't nearly as clever as the ""Spy Kids"" franchise. "
1532,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,50,USA Today, Stretching what was a cute concept to the breaking point. 
1533,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,42,Entertainment Weekly," At bottom, there's just too much spy in young Cody, and too little kid. The writers might've taken (another) page from the ''Spy Kids'' playbook and infused the action with youth relevance. "
1534,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,40,Dallas Observer," Given the great premise and characters inherited from the first film, it's surprising that this sequel fails to match its predecessor's appeal. The humor is silly, broad, and surprisingly generic. "
1535,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,40,L.A. Weekly," Muniz has a great face and body for physical comedy, but the numerous one-liners shoehorned into the script fall flat, unassisted by Anderson's numbing “street” ad-libs. "
1536,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,38,Chicago Tribune," It's a movie, and certain liberties are bound to be taken, but having Derek stop a moped-driving Brit on the street by pulling out some sort of identification and yelling, ""CIA, I need your moped!"" is not the way. "
1537,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," In terms of inspiration or even the slightest shred of ingenuity, Banks ranks more like an 000 than an 007. "
1538,Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,4.5,30,The New York Times," Mr. Allen's work is compromised by an apparent inability to match his shots in a spatially coherent fashion. It's never easy to tell who is chasing whom and in which direction, a needless confusion that dampens many of the thrills and scuttles quite a few gags. "
1539,Soul Plane,4.5,60,Film Threat," A lot better than one would expect. It's amusing, it's inspired and hey, it's a lot wittier than the last two ""Scary Movies"" combined. Though, like most lampoons, it runs out of steam about half way through. "
1540,Soul Plane,4.5,50,Miami Herald," An idea whose time is long overdue, a tricked-out jumbo jet custom fit to meet the needs of today's savvy black traveler. "
1541,Soul Plane,4.5,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," A raunchy spoof of the disaster-movie lampoon Airplane! - does everything to get the laugh. And in the way that a broken watch is right twice a day, a shotgun comedy like this one occasionally hits its target. "
1542,Soul Plane,4.5,50,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Has moments of inspiration, but the scattershot spoofing never achieves enough momentum to get this flight airborne. "
1543,Soul Plane,4.5,42,Entertainment Weekly," If you're looking for comic insights beyond the well-documented ass differential between whites and blacks, well, golly, you ought to try another carrier. "
1544,Soul Plane,4.5,40,Los Angeles Times, Flashy production design can't save Soul Plane from crashing and burning in a debris field strewn with stereotypes and raunch. 
1545,Soul Plane,4.5,38,USA Today," With its excessive sleaze and gross-out gags, Soul Plane overshoots effective spoofery. Mostly it's a foul, eye-rolling experience. "
1546,Soul Plane,4.5,30,TV Guide Magazine," While this flight should have been permanently delayed due to extraordinarily offensive conditions, there are no signs instructing you to remain seated should you decide to discreetly exit before your tour of the unfriendly skies is over. "
1547,Soul Plane,4.5,30,Washington Post," An hour and a half of real airplane turbulence is better than sitting through the bad, offensive material that makes up Soul Plane. "
1548,Soul Plane,4.5,25,Chicago Tribune," Let's make this simple: If you spend money on Soul Plane, you've been played. "
1549,Superhero Movie,4.5,58,The A.V. Club, Undiscriminating comedy fans hungering for the High School High of superhero parodies need look no further. 
1550,Superhero Movie,4.5,50,Variety," Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it's saying something that Superhero Movie provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of gags that just lie there aren't actively painful. "
1551,Superhero Movie,4.5,50,Boston Globe, How can you tell the target age for Superhero Movie is exactly 13 1/2 years? Because most of the jokes are Internet-related. 
1552,Superhero Movie,4.5,50,Los Angeles Times," The very act of writing critically about Superhero Movie inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances. "
1553,Superhero Movie,4.5,40,The Hollywood Reporter, By-the-numbers screen parody fails to resurrect an increasingly tired genre. 
1554,Superhero Movie,4.5,40,Chicago Reader," The gags are consistently weak, though actor Miles Fisher turns in a hair-raising impression of Tom Cruise. "
1555,Superhero Movie,4.5,40,Film Threat," What's shocking about Superhero Movie is not that it's been advertised to death on Nickelodeon to impressionable children, but that it's a completely on-the-nose satire of ""Spider-Man.” "
1556,Superhero Movie,4.5,30,L.A. Weekly," Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash. "
1557,Superhero Movie,4.5,30,The New York Times," No real mockery is intended by this harmless, mindless grab bag of slightly used gags, which lampoons some of the conventions of recent comic-book epics and adds the expected staples of juvenile humor: urine, vomit and intestinal gas. "
1558,Superhero Movie,4.5,0,TV Guide Magazine," This abysmal ""Spider-Man"" satire has more in common with the lamentable spate of ""Epic"" and ""Date Movies"" than Zucker and Nielsen's truly funny ""Naked Gun"" series. "
1559,Postal,4.5,60,Film Threat, It's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable. 
1560,Postal,4.5,42,The A.V. Club," A provocation first, an insult second, a publicity stunt third, and a film a distant fourth. "
1561,Postal,4.5,40,Variety, This anything-goes exercise isn't dull -- one just wishes the outrageousness were more consistently funny. 
1562,Postal,4.5,38,TV Guide Magazine," Postal's touches of wit are lost in the flying body parts, gross-out gags, and the full frontal spectacle of Foley's no-longer-private parts. "
1563,Postal,4.5,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto), What Boll gives us is a boring beating over the head. 
1564,Postal,4.5,25,New York Post, At last: Uwe Boll has made his first intentionally funny film. 
1565,Postal,4.5,20,Village Voice," Manages to be as toothless as he (Boll) is tasteless. Poorly framed, tone-deaf, and nonsensical (yet still Boll's best!). "
1566,Postal,4.5,10,The New York Times," Infantile, irreverent and boorish to the max, Postal explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking. "
1567,Postal,4.5,10,Los Angeles Times," Boll's rampant narcissistic showmanship creates such a bizarre, garish spectacle that it is almost tempting to give him credit for being something of a misunderstood artist after all. Almost, but not quite. "
1568,Postal,4.5,0,New York Daily News," Where Boll's movies were once amusingly atrocious, Postal is so aggressively tasteless and knowingly idiotic, there's just no fun to be had. "
1569,Rings,4.5,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Rings finds a couple of nice, if inconsequential, little chills. "
1570,Rings,4.5,30,Los Angeles Times," At no point does the movie manage even a single sequence of sustained tension, or a frisson of genuine terror. "
1571,Rings,4.5,25,Slant Magazine, Rings is unsure as to whether it’s a sequel to the other entries in the series or a contemporary reboot. 
1572,Rings,4.5,25,TheWrap," Horror films that backstory the audience to death lose all hope of mining what’s eerie and unsettling about the unknown, and Rings is a perfect example: it doesn’t so much spread its familiar myth as dilute it. "
1573,Rings,4.5,25,Consequence of Sound, Rings is too beholden with current trends to truly exploit the potential it displays in its early going. 
1574,Rings,4.5,25,RogerEbert.com," More wearying than frightening, Rings is a total non-starter. "
1575,Rings,4.5,20,Variety," The movie, which will be lucky to eke out a weekend’s worth of business, isn’t scary, it isn’t awesome, and it doesn’t nudge you to think of technology in a new way. But it does make you wish that you could rewind those two hours, or maybe just erase them. "
1576,Rings,4.5,20,New York Daily News," Filmmaker F. Javier Gutiérrez really doesn't have a lot to work with beyond a flimsy story, weak script and characters you'll have a hard time caring about. "
1577,Rings,4.5,20,Time Out London," Imagine simultaneously eating wallpaper paste, listening to Coldplay and watching the entire ‘Da Vinci Code’ trilogy back to back and you’ll have some idea how grindingly tedious the experience of watching Rings becomes. "
1578,Rings,4.5,16,IndieWire," Rings never solidifies into one of kind movie, cramming a handful of possibilities into its bloated running time. "
1579,Ouija,4.5,63,New York Post," It’s endearing how this glorified haunted-house movie tries to reclaim all the old tools, and do so with a straight face and a PG-13 level of violence. "
1580,Ouija,4.5,60,TheWrap," Given its double burden of being both a toy adaptation and a bloodless kiddie horror show, Ouija winds up being more fun that you might think, even if it's the sort of film you can't really take seriously for a second. "
1581,Ouija,4.5,50,Variety," This silly but straight-faced supernatural thriller manages to elicit an occasional shudder in between cheap jolts and false scares, emerging as a feat of competent direction (by debuting helmer Stiles White) over derivative scripting (by White and writing partner Juliet Snowden). "
1582,Ouija,4.5,50,The Playlist," The film is effectively scary, filled with plenty of jump moments and a few slow-burning scenes, but the scares aren’t enough to balance the poor writing and lack of imagination. "
1583,Ouija,4.5,40,New York Daily News," Cooke, a young Brit seen on TV’s “Bates Motel,” is strong as the diminutive brunette at the center of the interworldly fright-fest. Her charisma is almost enough to keep you from rolling your eyes at the script. "
1584,Ouija,4.5,40,The Dissolve, The most pressing issue with Ouija is that Stiles and Snowden cannot seem to write a single interesting line of dialogue. They volley between conversational banalities and whatever exposition might be needed to get the film to its next scary setpiece. 
1585,Ouija,4.5,38,St. Louis Post-Dispatch," Directed by Stiles White, whose credits lean more heavily in the special-effect arenas, Ouija is bland, safe horror for those who like their scares nonexistent. "
1586,Ouija,4.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," In the absence of anything truly original in the screenplay he co-wrote with Juliet Snowden, director Stiles White vainly attempts to ratchet up the tension with a series of cheap jump scares fueled by loud noises that are the cinematic equivalent of shaking hands with someone wearing a joy buzzer. "
1587,Ouija,4.5,25,San Francisco Chronicle, Ouija has something wrong with it from the first five minutes. 
1588,Ouija,4.5,25,USA Today, A deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie cliché. 
1589,Bitch Slap,4.5,40,Los Angeles Times," Despite its obsession with décolletage, Bitch Slap is surprisingly puritanical (much teasing, no pleasing), substituting plentiful violence and a howlingly predictable ""shock"" ending for the payoff it promises. "
1590,Bitch Slap,4.5,30,Variety," Overblown and underwhelming, Bitch Slap is a desperately unfunny attempt to satirically recycle cliches and archetypes from sexploitation actioners of the 1960s and '70s within the time-trippy, multiple-flashback framework of a Quentin Tarantino. extravaganza. "
1591,Bitch Slap,4.5,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Over-the-top -- and ultimately tiresome -- female mud-wrestling, kick-boxing and cat fights in a parody of old exploitation movies. "
1592,Bitch Slap,4.5,20,L.A. Weekly," In keeping with the film’s giddy superficiality, what’s revealed is a series of sexy poses passed off as character depth. All the backstabbing, shifting alliances and dark motives are held together by adolescent, innuendo-laden dialogue and thick Sapphic overtones. "
1593,Bitch Slap,4.5,0,San Francisco Chronicle," Bitch Slap is garbage. It's self-aware garbage - garbage that explores and celebrates, in postmodern fashion, precisely what it means to be garbage. But that doesn't make it stink any less. "
1594,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,70,Variety, A frenetic but undeniably funny follow-up that offers twice the number of singing-and-dancing rodents in another seamless blend of CGI and live-action elements. 
1595,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,50,USA Today, It seems as if no professional actors were hired in the making of this motion picture. 
1596,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,50,Village Voice," Closing out a pretty great year for children's movies—Betty Thomas's dutiful animated and live-action sequel to 2007's ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" brings up the rear with capable mediocrity. "
1597,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,50,Chicago Reader," Smarter than its predecessor, the movie aims for the ""High School Musical"" market. "
1598,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," As shrill, partly-animated musicals about singing vermin go, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel really isn't all that bad. "
1599,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,42,Entertainment Weekly," If only for the sake of adults, couldn't the folks behind the Alvin films have had the good grace to turn Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel into a musical? "
1600,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,40,Empire, Alvin does high school rom-com and very poorly at that. 
1601,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,40,The Hollywood Reporter, Charmless sequel. 
1602,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,38,Boston Globe, Almost but not quite as obnoxious as its title. Little kids will love it. You’ll need a hazmat suit. 
1603,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,4.5,20,Austin Chronicle, The Squeakquel might be appreciated by filmgoers aged 10 or younger. 
1604,Death Note,4.5,70,IGN," What’s frustrating is that with better lead performers and a tighter script, Wingard could have made a great adaptation. Instead it settles when it should have soared. "
1605,Death Note,4.5,63,Slant Magazine," Whereas the more grounded scenes of Death Note anchor a startlingly bloody fantasy of power run amok, the scenes that fixate on super powers and code-busting seldom manage to rise above the realm of serviceable YA fiction. "
1606,Death Note,4.5,60,The New York Times," Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books, movies, television shows and a stage musical), Death Note feels rushed and constricted. "
1607,Death Note,4.5,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Rather than relying on amplifying typical genre conventions, Wingard methodically lays the foundation to set up this particular Death Note adaptation for a potential sequel, but the outcome is more deliberate than inspired. "
1608,Death Note,4.5,50,Entertainment Weekly, The whole thing feels like the pilot episode of a third-rate comic-book vigilante TV show. 
1609,Death Note,4.5,50,Variety," The movie never quite reckons with just how twisted a concept it’s peddling, and that’s easily the scariest thing about it. "
1610,Death Note,4.5,50,Los Angeles Times," What Wingard has delivered is a fitfully entertaining, clearly compromised hybrid of action, horror and science-fiction. "
1611,Death Note,4.5,42,IndieWire," The only reason to take such a uniquely Japanese story and transplant it to Seattle is to explore how its thorny moral questions might inspire different answers in an American context, so for this retread to all but reduce America to its whiteness indicates an absence of context more than anything else. It’s the most glaring symptom of a film that utterly fails to investigate its premise. "
1612,Death Note,4.5,33,The Playlist," Wingard’s film is an incoherent mess of tones and styles, confused character motives, and murky narratives. "
1613,Death Note,4.5,10,TheWrap," The new horror-thriller is cheesy, asinine, convoluted and ludicrous. On the plus side, if your eyeballs need a vigorous workout, this will have them rolling nonstop. "
1614,Snatched,4.5,63,Movie Nation, It’s got enough laughs to get by. 
1615,Snatched,4.5,60,The Hollywood Reporter," Schumer and Hawn know what funny looks and sounds like, and they lend their dialogue and gags — no matter how tepid — enough snap and personality to distract you, at least some of the time, from the utter laziness of the material. "
1616,Snatched,4.5,60,Screen International," Often amusing but rarely shifting into a higher comedic gear, Snatched features fun chemistry between co-stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn, some delightfully goofy moments of stray hilarity, yet not enough story or heart to keep this thin tale afloat. "
1617,Snatched,4.5,58,Entertainment Weekly," As Snatched’s blonde-leading-the-blonde farce careens on, it stumbles into moments of deranged inspiration. "
1618,Snatched,4.5,50,The New York Times," Though this movie ostensibly celebrates the spirit of adventure and openness to experience, it takes no risks and blazes no trails. It’s ultimately as complacent, self-absorbed and clueless as its heroine, and not always in an especially amusing way. "
1619,Snatched,4.5,50,Variety, The movie’s mother-daughter jokes are like firecrackers with damp fuses. 
1620,Snatched,4.5,45,TheWrap," What we’ve gotten in Snatched is an uninspired, scattershot disaster romp that mostly serves the talents of one half of the marquee pairing, underuses the other half, and struggles to blend R-rated humor, foreign misadventure, and oil-and-water mother-daughter dynamic into a cohesive diversion. "
1621,Snatched,4.5,40,Village Voice, The noxious self-absorption of straight white women that Schumer has sent up so blisteringly on her Comedy Central show is extolled more than it is lampooned. 
1622,Snatched,4.5,40,Time Out London," Too much of the humour derives from Emily’s insatiable appetite for booze, food and sex, while the central mother-daughter relationship is predictable. "
1623,Snatched,4.5,25,IndieWire," Pairing up talented comedians like Hawn and Schumer with a wacky plotline to match should spell comedy gold, but Snatched is about as cheap and disposable as a tourist trap tchotchke. "
1624,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,75,IndieWire," Finally, the Fifty Shades phenomenon has yielded a disarming comedy that makes this ridiculous material fun to watch. "
1625,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,69,Vanity Fair," It’s hard to find compliments for Jamie Dornan beyond “very athletic”—but from start to finish, one can’t give Johnson enough credit for making these asinine movies work as well as they do. "
1626,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,45,TheWrap," It’s clichéd, stodgy and overly faithful to the original books. "
1627,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,40,The Hollywood Reporter," In terms of drama, or melodrama, or just bad drama, Freed rarely delivers the goods while trying hard to give fans what they came for. "
1628,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,40,Variety," Departing only incidentally from E.L. James’s trashy tome, and making up for any short cuts with extra set dressing, this is brochure cinema of the most profuse order, selling its audience more on a lifestyle than on any of the lives inside it. "
1629,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,38,Movie Nation," At least this time, some of the laughs are intentional. "
1630,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,33,The Playlist," Ostensibly aimed at an adult audience that craves equal parts romance and raunch, Fifty Shades Freed appears to have been written by a teenager – and not just because of its groan- and giggle-inducing dialogue, lack of emotional investment and thinly drawn characters. There’s no knowledge of any element of how the world functions, particularly in its approach to relationships. "
1631,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,30,Screen International," While we can quibble about the underused lead or the meandering plot, Fifty Shades Freed ultimately authors its own most stinging rebuke, closing on an extended montage highlighting major moments and turning points from the trilogy. Tellingly, none of them come from this film. "
1632,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,20,The Telegraph, This is a film in which one of the more emotionally detailed performances is given by a product-placement Audi. 
1633,Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,20,The Guardian," As usual it’s left entirely up to the beleaguered Johnson to make any of it even remotely watchable. She remains a compelling presence, trying her darnedest with lifeless words, but, again, she’s stranded by the energy-sucking vortex of nothingness that is Jamie Dornan. He’s better than this...but he knows it and his boredom is lazily apparent throughout. "
1634,Howard the Duck,4.6,60,Empire," Howard the Duck manages to be two or three types of fun: as a crazy comedy, it has some good risque/sick jokes to go along with its messy slapstick and bland rock music; as a monster movie, it has an outstanding performance from Jeffrey Jones as a scientist-cum-monster and an astonishingly repulsive Dark Overlord of the Universe shows up for the exciting climax. "
1635,Howard the Duck,4.6,60,IGN," There's something kitschy about Howard the Duck that makes it fun to watch. It tried hard and provided you're not a huge stick in the mud, there's something in this movie for everyone. "
1636,Howard the Duck,4.6,50,The New York Times," Howard the Duck' begins as a mild satire about a duck who fell to earth, but midway through, the star is upstaged by horrifying demons and dazzling light shows. "
1637,Howard the Duck,4.6,40,Variety," Pic lapses into formulaic predictability with nearly an hour of frenetic chase scenes and technically perfect explosions from Industrial Light & Magic. Action comes sporadically alive in scenes with scientist Jones, who becomes possessed by the spirit of an evil Dark Warlord that entered his body during the same fateful mishap that brought Howard to Earth. There is an abundant amount of special effects wizardry that emanates mostly from Jones as he transforms into a monster, but it is not spectacularly unique enough to distinguish this film from other, more entertaining, sci-fi thrillers. "
1638,Howard the Duck,4.6,25,The A.V. Club," The film resembles one of those Saturday Night Live sketches that has one joke and keeps going, and going, and going. "
1639,Howard the Duck,4.6,25,Rolling Stone," The problem was that it was supposed to be animated, but contractual obligations forced it to become a live-action movie — specifically, an unfunny, effects-driven, story-deprived live-action film about a talking duck. "
1640,Howard the Duck,4.6,25,TV Guide Magazine," There are a couple of mildly amusing moments, but overall Howard the Duck is a monumental waste of time. "
1641,Howard the Duck,4.6,25,The A.V. Club," Howard The Duck has several jokes, really, they're all just desperately unfunny. "
1642,Howard the Duck,4.6,20,Slate," Howard the Duck, the movie, is as bad as you've heard. Actually, it's worse. But its failings as a film have overshadowed the frequently brilliant 1970s comic book that inspired it. Using only the most superficial elements of its source material while discarding most of what made the comic interesting, the film serves as a textbook example of how to turn something into nothing. "
1643,Howard the Duck,4.6,20,Time Out London," Howard T Duck, of Marvel Comics, might well have a beef against Lucasfilm for transforming his magnetic comic strip personality into a zipperless polyester duck-suit (filled interchangeably by eight different actors, each apparently under four feet in height) in this aimless movie. "
1644,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,60,Time Out," For what it's worth (very little), probably the best in the series. "
1645,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,60,Variety," Jensen Daggett is a standout as the troubled young girl on whom Jason is fixated. V.C. Dupree has vibrant energy in his boxing scenes, Sharlene Martin has a fine time with the bitch role, and Martin Cummins is funny as a video freak who compulsively films the proceedings. "
1646,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,25,Chicago Tribune," It seems that as long as Jason can keep his costs down-by hiring unknown young actors, desperate for any kind of a break, and hiring directors (Rob Hedden this time) straight out of television or film school-he`ll be with us forever. Conveniently devoid of any personality (a variety of anonymous stunt men have filled the role over the years), he`s as infinitely reproducible as one of Warhol`s soup cans, though considerably less expressive. [31 July 1989, p.C3] "
1647,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,25,USA Today," To crystallize its fundamental flaw, here's a movie about Manhattan that takes 75 minutes just to get to Manhattan - followed by another 15 that could just as easily have been shot (and possibly were) in some East Topeka alley. [31 July 1989, p.4D] "
1648,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,20,TV Guide Magazine," During all of this tediously staged action, the virginal female heroine, Rennie Wickham (Jensen Daggett), suffers hallucinations about the young Jason. Not surprisingly, these scenes — which feel as if they belong in another movie — are among the most effective in the film, a welcome distraction from the mundane mechanics of the rest of this predictable effort. "
1649,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,20,The New York Times," But (Jason) will never change and never die, not while cheap, dull ax-murder movies can yield one witty, misleading, probably lucrative commercial. "
1650,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,10,Los Angeles Times, Funny ad campaign; a real dunghill of a major motion picture. 
1651,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,10,Washington Post," Also zero, which is the amount of inspiration and achievement in this continuing saga of the little boy who drowned in Crystal Lake 30 years, seven films and approximately 286 teenagers ago (30-7-286) "
1652,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,0,Austin Chronicle," I'll maim, chop, slash, and I'll kill, Just as I please. "
1653,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,4.6,0,Miami Herald," Putting this hackneyed villain in The Big Apple is a tantalizing concept, but Hedden rarely takes advantage of it. He deserves credit for a few shocks and some laughs from a gloom- and-doom deck swabber, but this is highly derivative stuff. And like many slash directors, he replaces suspense with short chases and violence. If audience response is a meter, Jason VIII is a dud. Save a few shrieks, the crowd fell victim to boredom. [31 July 1989, p.C5] "
1654,Junior,4.6,88,Chicago Sun-Times," A lot of actors can hold big machineguns and stand convincingly in front of special effects and explosions. Not many can stand in front of a camera and be nine months pregnant, and actually make us care. "
1655,Junior,4.6,63,Washington Post," A fleecy romantic caper with a dusting of feminism, the picture is basically a one-joke movie successfully nursed by director Ivan Reitman. "
1656,Junior,4.6,60,Newsweek," Neither hilarious nor horrible, Junior is the first would-be Arnold blockbuster that coasts on charm. "
1657,Junior,4.6,60,Empire," A daft movie, but one not without its moments of healthy radiance, spurred on by some bristling gags and a welcome comic return by Emma Thompson as a gauche fellow doctor caught in a romantic sub-plot. "
1658,Junior,4.6,60,The New York Times, Proceeds efficiently but never quite lives up to its own potential as a sight gag. 
1659,Junior,4.6,50,Austin Chronicle," Junior is passable entertainment, but it could hardly be called fully developed. "
1660,Junior,4.6,50,Entertainment Weekly," Schwarzenegger’s willingness to flirt with femininity, to become truly radiant, is the most engaging aspect of Junior. Unfortunately, the script doesn’t portray his transformation to starry-eyed pregnant bliss with much comic ingenuity. "
1661,Junior,4.6,50,San Francisco Chronicle," As a comedy, Junior has its share of laughs -- but no more than its share. "
1662,Junior,4.6,50,Washington Post," Let’s just say that, for the right audience, Junior may deliver. But there’s a whole lot of pregnancy to go through first. "
1663,Junior,4.6,38,ReelViews," The new Ivan Reitman/Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy is a one-joke affair, and it takes surprisingly little time for the potential humor in the situation to wear thin. "
1664,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,40,Empire, Never quite as witty as it should be. 
1665,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,40,Los Angeles Times, A fairly silly and ultra-gory schlocker/shocker. 
1666,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,30,Film Threat," It lacks humor. Unlike ""Scream"", this film is more of a horror-drama, with everybody taking themselves way too seriously. "
1667,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,30,The A.V. Club," There's gore aplenty here, but precious little suspense or terror. "
1668,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,30,Washington Post," More in the dumb and dumber tradition of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" sequels. "
1669,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,25,Chicago Sun-Times," Assembles the building blocks of idiot-proof slasher movies: Stings, Snicker-Snacks, false alarms and point-of-view baits-and-switches. "
1670,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,25,ReelViews," If there's a blessing, it's that the sequel isn't appreciably worse than the original - but that's slim praise considering how bad the first one was. "
1671,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,25,San Francisco Chronicle, It's standard slasher fare but has its moments. 
1672,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,25,San Francisco Examiner," The best that can be said about this film is that it's watchable, and that's not the way it could or should be. "
1673,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,4.6,0,Austin Chronicle," You want REAL terror? If this second outing proves profitable, we'll be looking at Yet Again I Recall the Summer Before the Summer Before Last. Now that's scary. "
1674,Driven,4.6,63,Chicago Sun-Times," The movie is so filled with action that dramatic conflict would be more than we could handle, so all of the characters are nice. "
1675,Driven,4.6,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Even if his (Stallone) own star may be fading, the popularity of car racing is enormous. These fans are not likely to be disappointed by Driven. "
1676,Driven,4.6,50,Philadelphia Inquirer, Driven is in both its script and its execution a paint-by-numbers affair. 
1677,Driven,4.6,40,New York Magazine (Vulture), Driven is recommended only to those gentle souls who want to know what it looks like to crash into a wall at 200 mph. 
1678,Driven,4.6,40,New Times (L.A.)," Stallone's script is well structured, though the jaw-droppingly banal dialogue gives us little reason to care. "
1679,Driven,4.6,38,Chicago Tribune," It's outrageously stereotypical and weirdly personal, so loonily exaggerated it keeps surprising you. "
1680,Driven,4.6,30,The New York Times," Even fans of open-wheel racing, the high-speed, high-stress pastime that is the subject of Renny Harlin's hectic new film, may walk away from it more logy than exhilarated. "
1681,Driven,4.6,25,Baltimore Sun, What we have here is a film where the first 20 minutes are repeated again and again until everything comes to an absolutely predictable end. 
1682,Driven,4.6,20,Austin Chronicle," It's not quite as bad as ""Cutthroat Island,"" I'll grant you, but it's woefully close. "
1683,Driven,4.6,10,Washington Post," An appallingly dull film set in the world of professional racing, director Renny Harlin and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone have found a way to drain all the adrenaline out of the sport. "
1684,Psycho,4.6,75,San Francisco Chronicle," Norman Bates is alive and well, and just a tad kinkier than you remember him. "
1685,Psycho,4.6,75,San Francisco Examiner," William H. Macy is fine as the detective Arbogast, wearing a hat he could have borrowed from Martin Balsam in the original role. "
1686,Psycho,4.6,63,New York Daily News," Cold, dull, lifeless. [5 December 1998, p.3] "
1687,Psycho,4.6,63,USA Today," Untantalizingly reverent remake. [7 December 1998, p.4D] "
1688,Psycho,4.6,60,Variety," A faithful-unto-slavish remake of the 1960 Hitchcock classic, pic contains nothing to outrage or offend partisans of the original, yet neither does it stand to add much to their appreciation. "
1689,Psycho,4.6,50,Film Threat," The movie doesn't stink. The performances are good, potentially great, especially Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. "
1690,Psycho,4.6,50,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," In the shock department, the ante has been upped, way up, and a mere kitchen knife through a shower curtain just doesn't cut it any more. "
1691,Psycho,4.6,50,TV Guide Magazine," Van Sant's film feels as dated as Hitchcock's, and Hitchcock's has the better excuse. "
1692,Psycho,4.6,38,Chicago Sun-Times," The movie is an invaluable experiment in the theory of cinema, because it demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted. "
1693,Psycho,4.6,38,ReelViews, Redundant and unnecessary. 
1694,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,80,Los Angeles Times," At a time when crassness and dumbing down pervade popular entertainment, especially movies aimed at youthful audiences, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen dares to be smart. "
1695,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,58,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Only Carol Kane, hilarious in roller curls and wide tortoiseshell glasses, gets to sink her teeth into her role. At least for Lohan, ""Confessions"" is her stepping-off point. Now she has to find a film to be her ""real"" stage. "
1696,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,50,TV Guide Magazine," A pretty little package whose perfect, fairy-tale ending is just a little too neat, the film's colorful wrapping includes veteran actress Carol Kane's bizarre but enjoyable performance as the school's uptight drama teacher. "
1697,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Girls ages 6-14 will get a charge from the fashion show, animation effects and, to a lesser degree, the cartoonish antics. But like most adolescent histrionics, the pic's impact on adults will be limited to mild amusement alternating with annoyance. "
1698,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,50,The New York Times," Modest, mildly engaging film. "
1699,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,50,New York Daily News," A safely sanitized comedy with an important message about loyalty and individuality, plays to Lohan's strengths and gives the target audience a chance to live it up vicariously. "
1700,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,40,Dallas Observer," Tethered to screenwriter Gail Parent's adaptation of Dyan Sheldon's novel, plus the demands of bigwig producers, it's a testament to Sugarman's artistry that she sustains her funky playfulness--a hallmark of her earlier work--throughout most of this film. "
1701,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,40,L.A. Weekly," Welsh director Sara Sugarman and the great cinematographer Stephen Burum (Hoffa, The Untouchables) keep the visuals bouncing along in bright, primary-color-intensive fashion, but the movie has no real heart and even less soul. "
1702,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,30,Washington Post," It's a silly, giggly piece of pink-colored fluff, as hyperactive as its heroine and as redolent of bubble gum and Love's Baby Soft cologne as Lola apparently is. Yet the superficial sweetness masks something rotten. "
1703,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,4.6,25,New York Post," Shlocky, sloppy and crass adolescent comedy. "
1704,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,70,The Hollywood Reporter, Sufficient cheap thrills and enough of the prevailing camp quality. 
1705,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,70,Variety," Sublimely trashy, this conceptual sequel to 1997's surprise hit, ""Anaconda,"" doesn't expect to be taken any more seriously than its schlock predecessor, and keeps its tongue-in-cheek thrills flowing rapidly. "
1706,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,50,Chicago Tribune," To be fair, it's little better or worse than the original. But, to be honest, the original--minus its nascent stars--wasn't very good. "
1707,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,50,Philadelphia Inquirer," From its jungle forays to its waterfall tumbles to its deadly spider bites - is entirely, utterly unoriginal. "
1708,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,50,TV Guide Magazine, Supremely silly but undeniably fun sequel. 
1709,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,50,The New York Times," A programmer that once upon a time would have played on the bottom half of double bills, Anacondas has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season. "
1710,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,40,Dallas Observer," Director Dwight Little, who has made many mediocre films as well as the gleefully gory Robert Englund version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" gets at least one thing right -- he really does take time to establish the characters. "
1711,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,33,Entertainment Weekly," There's no enjoyably outlandish hiss to this variation on the formula, and no Ice Cube or Owen Wilson, either. This time, a ship of capitalist fools (and no movie stars, unless you count utility player Morris Chestnut as a headliner) steams along the river in Borneo. "
1712,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,30,L.A. Weekly, What they don't do often enough is battle anacondas. It's all tease and no payoff. 
1713,Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,25,Miami Herald," This movie didn't have to be good, but that it's so boring in its badness is tough to swallow. "
1714,Black Christmas,4.6,50,L.A. Weekly," The flashbacks are wittily gothic, and the present-day murder scenes have the absurdist, chain-reaction intricacy of the ""Final Destination"" deaths. "
1715,Black Christmas,4.6,50,Austin Chronicle," This film is an evocative, effective entry into the holiday blood-spray subgenre in its own right. And if it doesn't make your skin crawl ... you probably ate too much Christmas dinner. "
1716,Black Christmas,4.6,38,Boston Globe," Silly, obvious, clumsy, and just gruesome enough to keep jaded genre fans from angrily throwing popcorn at the screen. "
1717,Black Christmas,4.6,30,Los Angeles Times," Like an ugly tie or a pair of slipper socks, Black Christmas is destined to be forgotten the instant it's unwrapped, gathering dust until the season rolls around again. "
1718,Black Christmas,4.6,30,The Hollywood Reporter," There are a couple clever touches here and there, including one sequence in which the end of a candy cane has been carefully licked into a highly lethal weapon, but for the most part the accompanying histrionics feel more regressive than retro. "
1719,Black Christmas,4.6,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," Lazy, perfunctory and free of tension, the new version will satisfy neither the admirers of the original nor anyone looking for a gory respite from seasonal good cheer. "
1720,Black Christmas,4.6,20,Empire," Bad film fans will think Christmas has come early, everyone else should ask for the receipt. "
1721,Black Christmas,4.6,20,The New York Times," With a peephole-riddled set and a flashback-heavy screenplay, Black Christmas smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little. "
1722,Black Christmas,4.6,10,Variety," It's debatable whether the original 1974 ""Black Christmas"" is, as its most rabid fans claim, the mother of all slasher movies. But there can be no argument regarding the scant merits of its slapdash, soporifically routine remake, suitable only for the least discriminating of gore hounds. "
1723,Black Christmas,4.6,10,Washington Post, The remake neither pays perceptive tribute to the original nor updates it in anything but hackneyed form. 
1724,Yogi Bear,4.6,67,Entertainment Weekly," There's nothing particularly inventive in the plot or grade-school humor, but the movie skates by on the timeless, undemanding charm of watching a tie-wearing bear try to steal people's lunches. "
1725,Yogi Bear,4.6,60,Village Voice," Adults will be thrilled to see Anna Faris as nature documentarian Rachel. Greeting Yogi by speaking in ""brown bear,"" the actress never fails to be seriously goofy. "
1726,Yogi Bear,4.6,55,Movieline," On the whole the film is not much fun to watch. A job is a job, though; Yogi Bear did little to make it more than that. "
1727,Yogi Bear,4.6,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Yogi is still smarter than the average bear, but Yogi Bear is much less smart than most of the year's kid-friendly cartoons. "
1728,Yogi Bear,4.6,50,Variety," A bland and innocuous small-fry outing that retains a measure of the original Hanna-Barbera cartoon's charm, though scarcely enough to justify the time, expense and visual-effects trickery it must have taken to inflate an endearing 2D cartoon into a dopey 3D extravaganza. "
1729,Yogi Bear,4.6,25,Tampa Bay Times," A smarter-than-average bear becomes a dumber-than-usual kiddie flick with Yogi Bear, the lone Christmas release specifically aimed at children, so it automatically qualifies as their lump of coal. "
1730,Yogi Bear,4.6,25,Orlando Sentinel, The best you can say about this Yogi Bear is that he's harmless. No animal was harmed in the making of this picture except the one Hanna-Barbera made a bundle on almost 50 years ago. 
1731,Yogi Bear,4.6,25,Chicago Tribune," Yogi Bear gives cheap hackwork a bad name. Which is a shame, because hackwork made this industry. "
1732,Yogi Bear,4.6,20,Boxoffice Magazine," Even the presence of Dan Aykroyd as Yogi and Justin Timberlake as his pint-sized straight man Boo Boo, couldn't save the movie. "
1733,Yogi Bear,4.6,20,Time Out," Yogi Bear on the big screen feels not just needless, but wasteful. "
1734,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,70,Movieline," The film is heavily reliant on jump scares, but its best moments are the ones before them, when the tension builds without the benefit of escalating music to queue you in to the approaching shock. "
1735,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,60,Total Film," Aside from the usual self-slamming doors and flying bodies, there are enough creepy kids and hiding knives to distract from a plot that's increasingly mobile yet running on the spot. "
1736,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,60,Boxoffice Magazine," Paranormal Activity 4 may mean more of the same, but in a modern horror landscape too often made up of equal parts of gore and boredom and resigned straight-to-video, it's a chiller designed to be seen in a crowded theater, and that alone makes it superior to its peers. "
1737,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,60,Empire, Catfish pair Joost and Ariel Schulman keep the franchise firmly on track with a satisfyingly scary fourth instalment. 
1738,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,60,Los Angeles Times, This film's strong suit is that it finally feels contemporary. 
1739,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,42,Entertainment Weekly," PA4 develops the story ever so slightly (not enough to satisfy fans) and delivers a few good scares (not enough to satisfy newbies); mostly, it plays like a overlong prologue for the already-in-the-works PA5. Here's hoping this is just the tension-racking lull before the next big scream. "
1740,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Fairly mild in tone and riffing -- if not quite ripping -- off a collection of horror classics that includes ""The Shining,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Poltergeist,"" both the franchise's premise and its execution nevertheless remain rudimentary, with the narrative and character backstories representing more of a sketch than a fully realized vision of the supernatural world that Katie inhabits. "
1741,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,40,Variety," Less reliant on slow-burn suspense and larded with fake-out jump scares, this is the first sequel in the series that fails to advance the overall mythology in any meaningful way. "
1742,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,40,Time," There's a point at which movies become only merchandise, and the Paranormal franchise may be heading for that nexus, that nadir. "
1743,Paranormal Activity 4,4.6,20,New York Daily News," PA 4's best idea, besides reintroducing the slow-walking, statuesque Katie, is a strange video trick involving lots of little lights filling a darkened room. It's tough to describe, but the cameras, of course, capture a figure the characters can't. "
1744,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,60,Screen International, The Ghost Dimension isn’t exactly frightening — the setup is so well-worn now that it’s hard to be particularly startled by what transpires — but it’s able to wring sufficient dread out of this franchise’s go-to fears. 
1745,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,58,Hitfix," To the bitter end, the series manages to wring some fun, solid scares out of something other invading something utterly familiar. "
1746,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,50,The A.V. Club," By making it so that everyone can see the evil coming, it also robs the franchise of one of its most potent pleasures: studying the frame for signs of trouble, little telltale hints that something is about to go horribly, horribly wrong. Sentient inkblots are a poor substitution for that sensation. "
1747,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,50,Los Angeles Times," At its most basic level, the Paranormal Activity formula still has some kick, with its combination of creepy lo-fi video and tasteful suburbia creating some strong, unsettling dissonance. "
1748,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,40,New York Magazine (Vulture)," If only Ghost Dimension spent more time in the ghost dimension and less time in the people dimension, we might have had something. "
1749,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,40,The New York Times," The Paranormal Activity movies have always been about carnival-ride sensations, the narrative through-line secondary. That’s fortunate, because those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed. "
1750,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,30,The Hollywood Reporter," Even at this late stage in the evolution of the franchise, logical lapses in filmmaking technique undercut the integrity of the found-footage format.... What may be less acceptable, however, is the film’s unaccountably weak effort to sort out the mythology concerning the series of demonic hauntings. "
1751,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,30,Variety," There may well be new and novel ways to spark audience shivers from not-so-bright homeowners inexplicably using their cameraphones to check out bumps in the night, but this series clearly has neither the patience nor the inclination to look for them anymore. "
1752,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,20,The Guardian, It’s a test of one’s tolerance for watching predominantly empty frames – the anonymous performers scarcely count – in the hope something will jolt us from mounting tedium. 
1753,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,4.6,12,RogerEbert.com, The sixth time is not the charm with this load of hooey that tries to make up for its lack of legitimate scares or basic narrative clarity by adding the alleged miracle of 3-D into the mix. 
1754,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,70,Variety," For all its structural and psychological deficiencies, it’s hard not to enjoy Fifty Shades Darker on its own lusciously limited terms. "
1755,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,58,IndieWire," Whipping up a proper tone for the big screen versions of E.L. James’ wildly popular novels was always going to be the films’ biggest problem, and while director James Foley might not quite nail it, wily injections of humor prove to be an unexpectedly helpful addition to the kinky franchise. "
1756,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,50,Boston Globe," Even with an improved Dornan, the movie still belongs to Johnson, a character actress capable of making light of a movie pretending to be darker. "
1757,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,50,Chicago Tribune," The last third of the film descends straight into a combination of ""Dynasty"" with shades of cult classic ""The Room."" It's fantastic because it's complete and utter silly madness. Helicopter crashes! Slaps! Drinks thrown in faces! Fully clothed shower sex! A framed ""Chronicles of Riddick"" poster! All the makings of an instant cult classic. "
1758,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,45,TheWrap," It’s nice that the two photogenic leads are treating sex like a pleasurable activity rather than an onerous chore in this second entry, but overall, the film plays like an un-asked-for collaboration between the Hallmark and Playboy Channels. "
1759,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,42,Entertainment Weekly, Darker is strangely plotless and devoid of any real tension. 
1760,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,40,Screen International," Sometimes sexy, sometimes campy, Fifty Shades Darker is a smorgasbord of silliness, its dopey pleasures indistinguishable from its many awkwardly melodramatic moments. "
1761,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,38,Movie Nation, A film which promises “darker” but delivers “funnier” — with some of the laughs intentional. 
1762,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,33,The Playlist," Pulseless, perfunctory and persistently watering down its kookier instincts, Fifty Shades Darker pales in comparison to the first. You might as well call it Fifty Shades Duller. "
1763,Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,30,The Hollywood Reporter, Leonard and Foley offer enough semi-naked sex scenes here to prove that quantity is no substitute for chemistry. 
1764,Showgirls,4.7,60,The New Republic," What matters much more than the story or the Spicy Stuff is the dancing, the show-biz dancing. It's electric. Exciting. And there's lots of it. [23 Oct 1995] "
1765,Showgirls,4.7,58,Entertainment Weekly," As Nomi, Elizabeth Berkley has exactly two emotions -- hot and bothered -- but her party-doll blowsiness works for the picture. "
1766,Showgirls,4.7,50,Chicago Sun-Times," If the plot and screenplay are juvenile, the production values are first-rate, and the lead performance by newcomer Elizabeth Berkley has a fierce energy that's always interesting. "
1767,Showgirls,4.7,50,Chicago Tribune," The film's big lap-dance sequence is impressive, however, if only for the sheer athleticism of Elizabeth Berkley's contortion. Later, when she pulls the same stunt in a swimming pool, we recognize the show for what it is--a male fantasy film in which the women are little more than rag dolls. [22 Sept 1995] "
1768,Showgirls,4.7,30,Washington Post, To take Showgirls that seriously (as either trash-art or appalling pornography) wouldn't be worth the exertion. 
1769,Showgirls,4.7,30,TV Guide Magazine," After an onslaught of prerelease hype promising the erotic experience of a lifetime, Showgirls reveals itself as a 131-minute dose of cinematic saltpeter. "
1770,Showgirls,4.7,25,San Francisco Chronicle," What's completely baffling is that everyone in the film thinks Nomi is one heck of a dancer, even though her one move -- throwing her arms out stiffly -- is straight out of ""Dr. Strangelove."" "
1771,Showgirls,4.7,0,Austin Chronicle," The story is so shabbily built that it can make no valid claim to motives other than the filmmakers' mercenary desires to cash in on the public's prurient interests. And even on this bottom-feeder level, Showgirls fails to deliver the goods. "
1772,Showgirls,4.7,0,San Francisco Examiner, That Berkley cannot act is indisputable. But her dancing looks like a seizure. 
1773,Showgirls,4.7,0,Los Angeles Times," Lacking the combustible Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in leading roles, Showgirls descends into incoherent tedium. Though the filmmakers' incessant talk about vision, artistry and honest self-expression lead one to expect a sexually explicit biopic about the Dalai Lama, what is in fact provided is depressing and disappointing as well as dehumanizing. "
1774,Anaconda,4.7,88,Chicago Sun-Times," A slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style. "
1775,Anaconda,4.7,75,USA Today," An enjoyably cast, superbly shot, jolt-generating device...It isn't art, but it'll crush your bones. "
1776,Anaconda,4.7,75,Christian Science Monitor," Coil up with a tub of popcorn, get a stranglehold on your soda - this is a creepy, action-packed boat ride down a jungle river with lots of huge snakes dropping by for man-sized snacks. "
1777,Anaconda,4.7,50,TV Guide Magazine," Voight's performance -- one of the film's pure, trashy delights -- is all leer, sneer and macho swagger, while the rest of the actors feel like the disposable snake-fodder they are. "
1778,Anaconda,4.7,50,Variety," A silly and plodding ""Jaws"" rip-off about a 40-foot man-eating snake on the prowl in the Brazilian rain forest. "
1779,Anaconda,4.7,40,Washington Post," Feels like ""Alien"" as directed by Jim Henson. And the suspense is restricted to mundane slasher-movie tactics, including the frequent use of a mobile camera (call it the ’condacam) that’s supposed to represent the snake’s point of view. "
1780,Anaconda,4.7,40,Chicago Reader," Jon Voight, the all-purpose villain, does a pretty good job of imitating Marlon Brando imitating a Paraguayan snake expert, but the rest of the players--including Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Vincent Castellanos, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer--seem to be in a hurry to pick up their checks. "
1781,Anaconda,4.7,25,San Francisco Chronicle," So desperate and silly that here and there, it's a lot of fun. "
1782,Anaconda,4.7,20,Austin Chronicle," Charmless, unfrightening, and even devoid of the requisite gratuitous nudity, Anaconda just plain bites. "
1783,Anaconda,4.7,0,San Francisco Examiner," If only director Luis Llosa and his cast could see the joke and seize upon it; instead, like its computer-morphed snake, the film doesn't have a clever bone in its body. "
1784,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,60,Dallas Observer," Definitely merits its R rating with a fearless approach that will earn genuine laughs as it turns a few stomachs. Yes, a Rob Schneider movie that's funny. Strange but true. "
1785,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,60,L.A. Weekly," As before, there are moments, when Schneider is turned loose to do his anything-goes, creepy-funny shtick, that are crudely inspired. "
1786,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,58,Entertainment Weekly," While sloppier than the sloppiest of seconds, is laudable in one important regard: Its obsession with the male body. "
1787,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,50,The Hollywood Reporter," Every bit as vulgar, sophomoric and thoroughly tasteless as 1999's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. But what is most annoying is the sequel's capability of inducing laughter even as one hates oneself for so easily succumbing to the total silliness of it all. "
1788,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,50,Los Angeles Times," Director Mike Bigelow maintains a mercifully swift pace, and while the film's humor is deliberately as crass as humanly possible, it is not truly mean-spirited, even though Amsterdam is depicted as a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. "
1789,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,30,Variety," Rude, crude and, uh, cosmopolitan, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo waves the flag for R-rated politically incorrect studio comedy but doesn't top the laugh ratio of the first Deuce misadventure. "
1790,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,30,Washington Post," It's not Deuce's satisfied clientele, but the audience, that gets the shaft. "
1791,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,25,Chicago Tribune," The director is first-timer Mike Bigelow. Nothing's paced or shaped for maximum payoff; the shooting and editing rhythms add only clutter and noise, and the slapstick is strictly of the skull-banging, ear-splitting variety. "
1792,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,0,Chicago Sun-Times," Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks. "
1793,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,4.7,0,Seattle Post-Intelligencer," Not that there are any actual jokes to be had. The film simply jumps to the punch lines, a non-stop barrage of crude dialogue and vulgar sight gags that passes as humor among adolescent boys. Who exactly is the audience for this R-rated film? The terminally immature? "
1794,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,50,The New York Times," It may not be classic sci-fi like the original “Alien,” which it has in its DNA, but it’s a perfectly respectable next step in the series. "
1795,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,50,Variety, Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product. 
1796,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,50,L.A. Weekly," Chopped down to 40 minutes, this could be a wickedly cool short; as is, it’s a passable slasher that’s still nowhere near the interspecies smackdown we geeks have long imagined. "
1797,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,40,The Hollywood Reporter, A dull actioner that looks like a bad video game. 
1798,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,40,Los Angeles Times," Aliens vs. Predator -- Requiem simply exists, nodding to the continuity of the larger series and opening the door for, yes, another entry in the franchise. In Hollywood as in outer space, spawn begets spawn. "
1799,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,38,TV Guide Magazine," The film's major draws are R-rated gore and some nice physical effects, proof that a man in a top-of-the-line monster suit can still be more effective than CGI. "
1800,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,30,Austin Chronicle," An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy, and slobbering carnage designed to bore straight into the pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave the rest of us wondering when the movies got so damn loud. "
1801,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,25,ReelViews," --- Ho, ho, ho - the joke's on anyone who pays to see this. "
1802,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,12,Boston Globe," The problem with the ""Alien vs. Predator"" series is that the humans keep getting in the way. "
1803,AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem,4.7,0,The A.V. Club," A tasteless, witless, mindlessly perfunctory bloodbath that has the discourtesy to take itself seriously. Pitting aliens against predators may be the height of frivolity, but God forbid anyone have fun with it. "
1804,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,75,Entertainment Weekly," These are standard youth-movie dilemmas, but they're brought to life by the high-energy cast and the musical numbers, which Ortega shoots with electrifying pizzazz. "
1805,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,75,Chicago Tribune," What it lacks in narrative ambition, it makes up for in dazzling choreography. "
1806,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,75,Philadelphia Inquirer," For the most part, the film's musical numbers are dynamic, propelling the story forward. The same cannot be said about Peter Barsocchini's colorless screenplay. "
1807,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,70,Washington Post," Exudes genuine appeal, thanks to director Kenny Ortega's brilliant choreography and a gifted cast. "
1808,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,63,USA Today," Even if the refreshing gust doesn't stay with you long, it's fun while it lasts. "
1809,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,58,The A.V. Club," Efron is the epitome of sexless Disney heartthrobs, but he's an electrifying song-and-dance man, so much so that his castmates (Bleu excepted) look like they have concrete shoes by comparison. "
1810,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,50,The Hollywood Reporter, The result unfortunately has the blandness of a mediocre TV sitcom. 
1811,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,50,Variety," While Ortega and fellow choreographers Charles Klapow and Bonnie Story stretch their imaginations, there's something almost lazy about the picture's underachiever script. "
1812,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,50,L.A. Weekly," Set against a production design seemingly inspired by the American flag, director Kenny Ortega's choreography is industrial and efficient, if haplessly stranded somewhere between Michael Jackson and the Village People. "
1813,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,4.7,25,Rolling Stone," If you're gay and/or eight years old, HSM3 is the movie event of the year. "
1814,Jonah Hex,4.7,50,Chicago Sun-Times," It's based on some DC Comics characters, which may explain the way the plot jumps around. We hear a lot about graphic novels, but this is more of a graphic anthology of strange occult ideas. "
1815,Jonah Hex,4.7,50,Orlando Sentinel," Brolin is so damned good in the saddle, in the hat and in the part that a half-sober viewer could half forget how half-arsed this movie he's starring in is. "
1816,Jonah Hex,4.7,50,Boston Globe, The only thing sadder than Jonah Hex is what appears to have happened to his movie. 
1817,Jonah Hex,4.7,42,Tampa Bay Times, Jonah Hex isn't abrupt by design but by desperation. 
1818,Jonah Hex,4.7,40,The Hollywood Reporter," It admittedly starts off great guns, but all too quickly it becomes apparent that the big-screen arrival of the supernatural Western DC Comics series Jonah Hex""is firing loud, empty blanks. "
1819,Jonah Hex,4.7,40,Variety," The film's noisy, slam-bang approach and lack of imagination in all nonvisual departments will keep it from rounding up a fresh generation of thrill-seekers. "
1820,Jonah Hex,4.7,38,Philadelphia Inquirer, A mercifully fleet and lamentably uninteresting adaptation of the DC Comic about a war-weary Confederate soldier. 
1821,Jonah Hex,4.7,30,Arizona Republic," Jonah Hex somehow manages to waste the talents of Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, Michael Fassbender, Will Arnett, Aidan Quinn and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in a story that combines vengeance, the occult and an Old West war on terror (really). "
1822,Jonah Hex,4.7,25,Premiere," Jonah Hex tries to hedge its bets too much, and the result is a movie that probably won't please the few faithful with Jonah Hex bedsheets, nor fans of mindless summer action flicks. "
1823,Jonah Hex,4.7,0,The A.V. Club," Every once in a while, a film limps into theaters so stitched together, it's a wonder it doesn't rip apart in the projector. Jonah Hex is such a film. "
1824,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,75,Chicago Tribune," Why does “New Moon” basically work, even with its grave self-seriousness? A few reasons. Weitz lets the material breathe, and his actors interact. The film does not try to eat you alive. "
1825,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,70,Variety," Carried by Kristen Stewart's compellingly dark performance, but also by helmer Chris Weitz's robust visuals. "
1826,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,63,USA Today," The werewolves have it all over the blood-suckers in The Twilight Saga: New Moon. When these oversize, hirsute creatures burst onto the screen, they inject life into a rather inert story. "
1827,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,60,Time Out," Is this sequel defending its fan base and preempting criticism about its transparent agenda? This IS a soap opera, folks--and acceptable escapism for those old enough to see it yet still young enough to shriek at undead dreamboats. "
1828,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,60,Los Angeles Times," Constrained by the plot of the novel, the film keeps the two lovers apart for quite a spell, robbing the project of the crazy-in-love energy that made ""Twilight,"" the first entry in the series, such a guilty pleasure. "
1829,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,60,New York Daily News," Weitz takes a looser approach than the series’ last director, Catherine Hardwicke, did. He has a better sense of humor, too. "
1830,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,50,San Francisco Chronicle," Let's just say it: It's great there's a movie that makes teenage girls scream. Half the movies Hollywood makes are designed to make teenage boys scream, and those boy movies are just as ridiculous and a lot nastier than New Moon. "
1831,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,50,Boston Globe," Where the first film’s director, Catherine Hardwicke, plugged into Meyer’s vision of supernatural teenage lust with abandon, Chris Weitz is stuck with a sequel that’s a morning-after mope-fest. "
1832,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,38,New York Post, New Moon is supposed to be an exciting love story plus monster action. So where’s the excitement? Where’s the action? 
1833,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.7,25,Chicago Sun-Times," The Twilight Saga: New Moon takes the tepid achievement of ""Twilight"" (1988), guts it, and leaves it for undead. "
1834,Zoolander 2,4.7,80,Time Out London," Mostly, Zoolander 2 hits the mark with style. Just don’t expect anything too deep. "
1835,Zoolander 2,4.7,60,The Guardian," There are always some laughs to be had here, and Ben Stiller’s couture legend now has an endearingly muppety look. "
1836,Zoolander 2,4.7,60,The Telegraph," It’s fun to see Zoolander once more. It seems unlikely that the premise could ever sustain a third film, but if this is Derek’s swan song then he leaves amid a flurry of feathers and bustle – surely all a male model could wish for. "
1837,Zoolander 2,4.7,60,Total Film," More Blue Steel than Magnum, this is a perfectly serviceable sequel, but dogged by repetition, it lacks the original's speed and sizzle. "
1838,Zoolander 2,4.7,42,Entertainment Weekly," Zoolander No. 2 is embarrassing, lazy, and aggressively unfunny. The only good news is that at the pace the franchise is moving, we won’t get Zoolander 3 until 2030. "
1839,Zoolander 2,4.7,40,The Hollywood Reporter," Sure, it's a kick to see Stiller and Wilson back in the shoes of these camera-ready cretins, but for every joke that sparks there are several that just lay there. "
1840,Zoolander 2,4.7,40,Screen International," The stakes are higher, the action is bigger, the ambitions are grander, the jokes are appreciably less funny. Like many comedy sequels, Zoolander 2 supersizes everything in such a way that it’s that much more apparent how few of the jokes are connecting. "
1841,Zoolander 2,4.7,38,Movie Nation," A “high concept comedy” from the days when those were a thing, it’s basically a cacophony of cameos and random sight gags hurled at the viewer in a tsunami of haute couture hype. "
1842,Zoolander 2,4.7,25,TheWrap," There are no build-ups or pay-offs here, just a lot of random moments of people saying stupid stuff, and fashion people being gently lampooned. "
1843,Zoolander 2,4.7,20,Variety," The results may delight those who believe recycled gags and endless cameos to be the very essence of great screen comedy, but everyone else will likely recognize Stiller’s wannabe Magnum opus as a disappointment-slash-misfire, the orange mocha crappuccino of movie sequels. "
1844,Ra.One,4.8,100,Los Angeles Times," Anubhav Sinha's exhilarating fantasy Ra.One is Bollywood at its best. It has energy, spectacle and humor, song and dance, but razzle-dazzle special effects and action stunts never overwhelm its story of enduring love that unfolds amid an intricate and inspired sci-fi odyssey. "
1845,Ra.One,4.8,80,New York Daily News," This wildly entertaining Bollywood action-comedy, with Indian superstar Shahrukh Khan in two roles, pays homage to such '90s flicks as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""The Matrix,"" adding whimsy and loads of heart. "
1846,Ra.One,4.8,80,Salon," If you're bored by the action scenes or the love story or the dopey domestic comedy, just wait three minutes for something else to come along - and whoever you are, you won't be bored by the musical numbers! "
1847,Ra.One,4.8,70,The Hollywood Reporter," You don't have to be an enthusiast of Bollywood to embrace RA.ONE, but it sure would help. "
1848,Ra.One,4.8,60,The New York Times," If the storytelling disappoints (shocking!), the film mostly doesn't. It relies on action and effects and Bollywood's trump card, star power, to carry the day. This is Mr. Khan's movie, and once he sheds Shekhar's droopy locks, he shines as the deadpan, action-hero robot with digital snot and smooth moves on the dance floor. "
1849,Ra.One,4.8,50,Variety," Much of the film is marked by a sense of dead air, owing to the fact that there's not a lot of story, but nevertheless, per Bollywood conventions, a lot of time to fill. "
1850,Ra.One,4.8,25,The Globe and Mail (Toronto)," And yes, the super effects are fantastic. But overall, Ra.One fails to impress. "
1851,Ra.One,4.8,25,Slant Magazine, But all the charm in the world wouldn't make Ra.One's sanctimoniousness seem any more genuine. 
1852,God's Not Dead,4.8,40,The Hollywood Reporter," The film has entertaining moments, but these are clearly secondary to its proselytizing intentions. "
1853,God's Not Dead,4.8,38,McClatchy-Tribune News Service," The pace is stumbling, the characters are broad, the makeup and the performances uneven, though Sorbo dives into his tactless, unethical indoctrinator role with Satanic glee. "
1854,God's Not Dead,4.8,20,Variety," Even grading on a generous curve, this strident melodrama about the insidious efforts of America’s university system to silence true believers on campus is about as subtle as a stack of Bibles falling on your head. "
1855,God's Not Dead,4.8,20,The Guardian, Ban this sick filth. 
1856,God's Not Dead,4.8,16,The A.V. Club," Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God’s Not Dead is a disaster. "
1857,God's Not Dead,4.8,0,Austin Chronicle, Any just God would likely recoil from the ham-fisted and spurious defense put forth in this film. 
1858,Meet the Blacks,5.9,60,The Guardian," Meet the Blacks is an asinine film (though with a kernel of seriousness) but whenever it feels like it is running out of steam, something strange and surreal will happen to elevate it above a typical spoof movie. "
1859,Meet the Blacks,5.9,33,The A.V. Club," It’s more like an extremely confusing and sloppily written chunk of Purge fan-fiction—a tortured use of another movie’s absurd mythology to help make muddled quasi-satirical points, while indulging the apparently fail-safe punchline of saying the word “purge” about once a minute. "
1860,Meet the Blacks,5.9,25,RogerEbert.com," Even by the standards of raunchy, comic spoofs, director and co-writer Deon Taylor’s film feels especially scattered. "
1861,Meet the Blacks,5.9,10,The Hollywood Reporter," A wrongheaded, utterly incompetent, and nearly laugh-free satire. "
1862,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,91,Entertainment Weekly," Parents who have had to sit through a myriad of mindless kids movies will appreciate a chance for their kids to be themselves at the theater and to be silly right alongside them. On the whole, it can serve as a good introduction to the movie-going experience. "
1863,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,60,Boxoffice Magazine," The song and dance interaction of kids hollering advice during Blue's Clues happens here on the big screen, which is meant to transform the movie into a social event of sorts. "
1864,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,50,Village Voice," If today's youngsters grow up thinking of Christopher Lloyd as the old guy with the bongos from The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure, at least they'll be thinking of Christopher Lloyd at all. "
1865,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,30,Los Angeles Times," For the sake of the children, The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure should be allowed to quietly float away. "
1866,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,30,The New York Times, Hallie's dad said it was Rocky Horror for toddlers whatever that is. Me and Hallie are 7 and we thought it was for babies. 
1867,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,30,Variety," The low-budget production feels chintzy and impossibly square, even by tyke standards. "
1868,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,25,Boston Globe," Will your preschoolers enjoy it? Perhaps. Is it worth 88 minutes of their lives, or yours? Not in a world where ""Sesame Street"" is on TV every day. Not even in a world where ""Sesame Street"" didn't exist. "
1869,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,25,San Francisco Chronicle, The whole thing runs about an hour too long: It should have been a TV show. The adventure's too big for the kids who would love it the most. 
1870,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,20,New York Daily News," If only the movie could live up to its own potential. Instead, we're stuck with blandly unappealing costumed characters meandering through a boring quest to find some lost balloons. "
1871,The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure,6.0,12,Slant Magazine, Enduring this brainless kid's film is akin to witnessing the end of the world.
